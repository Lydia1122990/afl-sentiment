Bluesky,comment,brisbanelions,-0.019,I'm sure there are annoyed Lions fans out there but I'm not one of them. 2 points is better than 0 and I honestly think we're lucky to even get the 2 this week. North played better than us. Also it now seems to be an annual tradition for the Lions to get a draw on Mother's Day,1,2025-05-11T13:08:12.247Z,https://bsky.app/profile/hypnicjerk.bsky.social/post/3lovjm2d7n22l
