    "text": "Sir James Douglas: The Mixed Legacy of Fort Langley’s Founding FatherAuthor(s): Scott Douglas JacobsenPublication (Outlet/Website): Personal SubStackPublication Date (yyyy/mm/dd): 2025/04/01Long fore-running the days of all the major visitation spots in British Columbia, before the time of the founding of Canada on July 1, 1867, prior to the foundation of Fort Langley (though concomitant with it, later), definitively before the title of “Fort Langley National Historical Site of Canada,” or the places of art and the galleries[1], the accommodations[2], the restaurants[3], the businesses dealing in finance and real estate[4], the floral and bridal and antique shops[5], the gift and health & beauty shops[6], visitation spots and services[7], or any of the local community groups and activities and events and items[8], or the introduction of highly educated and well-to-do Evangelical Christians throughout the area from Trinity Western University, the fights at the Supreme Court of Canada for the Evangelical law school, the infamous artist and developer fights[9], or the civic debates of the Township of Langley Cllrs.[10], or such inane, and banal and almost pointless, meanderings as written by the current author on the subject(s) surrounding Fort Langley[11], there existed one individual by the name of Jim Douglas, or Sir James Douglas, KCB[12] (no known relation).*[13] A man whose life seems more titivating with nuance added to the story, small enhancements made clear, while learning more about him: Mr. Mix-A-Lot.So many parties wish to lay claim to the titular ownership of “Fort Langley National Historic Site of Canada,” only a few wish to understand without claiming it. There’s a vast gulf between the former and the latter only learned through hard experience and conversations with the peoples of the area, settler or not. Douglas was the Governor of British Columbia 1858–1864 and of Vancouver Island 1851 to 1864. He did not start here. Born August 15th, 1803, in Demerara, Guyana (formerly British Guiana), his legacy between and death — on August 2nd, 1877 — remains the founding of British Columbia or, more colloquially, as “The Father of British Columbia.” Neither a minor figure in the community village nor in the provincial history, he set the tone and calibre of the attractiveness of the colonial outposts here. He assisted the Hudson Bay Company acquire a trade monopoly in the Pacific Northwest, as the Chief Factor of HBC from 1839 to 1858. He helped establish British rule west of the Rocky Mountains as the governor of Vancouver Island and British Columbia. A part of this had to do with the negotiation of land purchases with the First Nations. His career took him through the Fraser River Gold Rush, Cariboo Gold Rush, and the Fraser Canyon War.Guyana, at the time of his birth, was a Dutch colony. His father, John Douglas, owned a cotton and sugar plantation in Demerara. John was a Scottish Merchant who came from the Earls of Angus. One of the oldest of the known mormaerdoms, regional/provincial rulers. His mother, Martha Ann Ritchie, was born in Bardados as a free woman of colour. ‘Person of colour’ referred to someone of mixed African and European heritage. In other words, a non-enslaved mixed ‘race’ woman. Martha met John while he was on the plantation business. They never married and had three children with John returning to Scotland, and who married in 1809 to begin anew with another family. Sir James Douglas — a man of mixed ‘race’ or ethnic heritage — and his brother, Alexander Douglas, were sent to Lanark, Scotland, to become educated. James never went back to Demerara and never saw his mother again — such were the times. They had three children together, though they never married. John Douglas returned to Scotland, where he married in 1809 and started a second family.With the North West Company or the NWC, (Sir James) Douglas was 15 when he became a part of the working staff. He apprenticed with them, then sailed to Montreal, so was working in the fur trade learning its accounting practices. There was a period of intense competition between the NWC and the Hudson Bay Company or the HBC at the time. It was a mostly economic battle between trade giants. Douglas was caught in this as a teenager. Apparently, in 1820, he fought an HBC guide, Patrick Cunningham, in a bloodless duel. When the NWC merged with the HBC, Douglas became employed by the HBC. The HBC won the economic war. His first posting was in 1826 at Fort St. James in the mainland of modern British Columbia. Chief Factor, William Connolly, requested Douglas to become part of the overland fur brigade at Fort Alexandria to Fort Vancouver. Such as the times were, Douglas, in fact, married Connolly’s daughter, Amelia. Now, bearing in mind, Douglas comes from a mixed-race mother or free woman of colour and a Scottish father; Amelia’s mother was Cree. Ergo, a mixed ethnic background — First Nations and European — wife, Amelia, and mixed Guyanese and Scottish husband, James (Douglas), for a mixed ethnic coupling.Which is to say, taking a moment to opine, even for today, this retains a character of the revolutionary to it. In that, even within the modern discourse of inter-ethnic couples, striving new paths and creating bridges in Afro-Canadian and Indigenous lives, Douglas simply did it. He did more, talked less. Amelia and James married on April 27th, 1828, and, again, at an Anglican ceremony in Fort Vancouver (1837). Something of a renewal of vows, presumably, and a sacralization of the union under the auspices of the Anglican Church. Within Fort Vancouver, Chief Factor John McLoughlin was the boss of Douglas, while Douglas was the superintendent of Columbia District fur trade for two decades. Douglas went to Alaska in 1840 to negotiate trade/boundary deals with the Russian American Company. Much of Douglas’s efforts vis-à-vis trade and boundary building appears part of a local effort against international efforts, including the Russians, though more acutely the Americans, with an increase in the American influence on the Pacific Northwest, Douglas started the construction of Fort Victoria (1843). Circa 1846, British North America in the West and the United States had a border set at the 49th parallel based on the Oregon Treaty (June 15th, 1846). Originally, the land was jointly held by the Americans and the British through the 1818 Treaty. This was monumental to British-American relations. The HBC moved from Fort Vancouver, presumably as a response. Douglas began a new fur brigade from Fort Langley to New Caledonia, then Fort Victoria became the place for furs shipped from the interior for the HBC.With the continued threat of American expansionism, Vancouver Island was made a Crown colony (January 13th, 1849). Douglas was appointed an agent for the HBC on the island. Interestingly, in a twist of finance and trade overruling political power, Richard Blanshard was chosen by the British government as the governor; however, as it turns out, Blanshard found most of the associations were held in the hands of the HBC with the individual British colonists mostly associated with the HBC and power invested in the chief factor of the HBC — by that time, James Douglas, himself. In short, he chose to resign and leave Vancouver Island (August, 1851). ‘Why bother?,’ in other words. On October 30th, 1851, Sir James Douglas was selected as governor. In association with the HBC and while the governor, he was criticized for a conflict of interest. Even further, and not to his credit, Douglas appointed his brother-in-law as the chief justice of the Supreme Court of the time. Circa 1856, Douglas was — by definition — elitist in considering people wanting the rule classes to make the decisions for them. Sort of, ‘Get them, the fray, out of our hair, and let us get one with making the important decisions,’ as the attitude, that’s astonishing for someone of mixed ethnic heritage from Demerara. When making a legislative assembly — based on a request from the Colonial Office, Douglas put property qualifications on the right to vote. In other words, only a few could count for membership in the assembly: land-owners versus the rest, in short. Sir James Douglas was not democratic; he was anti-democracy, or a timocratist erring more on land-ownership side rather than the inherent sense of honour. In ironic fashion, we, in modern democratic Canada, honour Sir James Douglas, the timocratwho opposed universal suffrage.[14]Between 1850 and 1854, Douglas negotiated land treaties with First Nations on Vancouver Island. 14 in total. The Fort Victoria Treaties or Douglas Treaties were cash, clothing, blankets, hunting and fishing rights, etc., in barter for land. In traditional colonial fashion, Douglas left the terms of the agreements blank at the time of the signing. So, the clauses were added at a later time. Is anyone else seeing a problem here? Douglas, in this wrinkle, too, was not a saint; he was through-and-through a settler in mind. Some oral history from the Indigenous claim the signatories — the Indigenous signatories — thought the signings were land sharing deals or peace signings, so sharing and not ceding land. Do you see the issue? The X signed looked like the Christian symbol of the cross, so a spiritual gesture — not the proverbial John Handcock, and so on and so forth. With the coming of Americans from California, too, during the Fraser River Gold Rush, the numbers of Americans to British subjects began to swell. So as to protect the land for the Crown (the British rulers), Douglas claimed the land and minerals for them. Licenses were given to miners to prevent invasion. This was seen as an attempt to keep HBC monopolization. He was reprimanded by the Colonial Office.Douglas was a completely sympathetic individual to the British. He was a loyalist. Even so far as to go to the San Francisco Black community to find migrants sympathetic to the Crown, the issue was the increasing numbers of American migrants coming to the areas around Douglas without necessary identity links to Britain. Since the United States Supreme Court declared free and enslaved Black Americans unable to acquire citizenship in 1857, Douglas, ever the man looking for opportunities, offered citizenship after 5 years of land ownership. A few hundred Black American families moved to the colony in Victoria. In some ways, one can ask, “Is this good or bad?” It was politically opportunistic in service to the British; it was socially beneficial in giving the disenfranchisemed some modicum of enfranchisement. It depends on the aperture and the angle of the lighting.Nlaka’pamux communities were the Indigenous communities along the Fraser River. Douglas worried of bloodshed between the Nlaka’pamux and the American miners, and warned the British who could not respond in time. American miners came and reached the lower Fraser River. Sexual violence was reported to happen against the Nlaka’pamux women. Gold was mined without Nlaka’pamux communities’ consultation. Nlaka’pamux fishing was interrupted. Nlaka’pamux communities armed to protect themselves, some of them. Douglas ordered one gunboat on the Fraser River and wanted licenses from miners who went to find gold. Having no army, so no force, and asking for help from the British, the British responded to the plea for help: Staking a claim to the Fraser River as part of the Crown. Alas, August, 1858 found Nlaka’pamux communities and the miners at war. Some 36 people (5 chiefs) were murdered, 3 were imprisoned, and unknown others were wounded. 5 Nlaka’pamux communities were burned down by the miners. By August 22nd, a truce was set. Comically, Douglas arrived with 35 armed men from the British government, though the fighting had ended by that point — fruitless pursuit of peace when a truce has been brokered.Gold changes everything. Britain chose to remove the HBC privileges during March of 1859 with the discovery of gold. Douglas was made governor of British Columbia while on condition of no more ties to the fur trade industry. Although, governor of Vancouver Island at the time. He was inaugurated as governor of British Columbia in — of all places — Fort Langley, then made Companion of the Order of the Bath for work as governor on Vancouver Island. Fort Langley almost became the first capital of British Columbia. On January 6th, 1859, Royal Engineer Commanding Officer Colonel Richard Clement Moody went by Fort Langley en route to Yale. After visitation of the site, he decided a better place would be New Westminster, which became the first capital of British Columbia. With 1866 came the merger of the colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia, thereafter, Victoria became the capital of British Columbia. Douglas focused on the welfare of miners and setting reserves, via gold commissioners, for the Indigenous peoples. He, probably, didn’t want a repeat of war, as before, and worked on a land policy inclusive of mineral rights. In 1860, British Columbians wanted a form of popular government. He had to be confronted by the citizens, in other words. Whatever the response, the citizens were not happy with Douglas’s response to them. They petitioned the London Colonial Office in 1863. Douglas, subsequently, retired in 1864; these petitioners may or may not have influenced the decision. He was given the title of “Sir” as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, thusly came to be known — to the plains-folk of the land of Fort Langley — as Sir James Douglas of Douglas Day fame. He died of a heart attack on August 2nd, 1877, incidentally the informal birth date of In-Sight Publishing (2012). All information above is publicly available on the “Father of British Columbia.” A governor, a chief factor, a British loyalist or someone tied deeply to the Crown, a latecomer to war needs, a diplomat knowing the influence of material goods to keep communities at peace, a mixed-ethnicity man (European and Guyanese) married to a mixed-ethnicity woman (First Nations and European) in an inter-ethnic union, someone opposed to popular democracy in favour of a form of ‘democracy’ more closely resembling timocracy or rulership by those who own land. Neither entirely evil nor wholly good, a mixed man of mixed heritage with mixed morals leaving a mixed legacy as “The Father of British Columbia.”[1] Gallery 204, Kube Gallery, Berga Gallery, Barbara Boldt Studio, Jelly Digital Marketing, Fort Photo Images, Photography Elements, Fort Gallery Artists Collective, Fort Langley Artists Group, Elaine Brewer White Studio, The Neighborhood Art School, FREE iWork PAGES Templates, Old Dog Dons ~ Fort Sketches, Van Gogh Painting & Restoration, K’wy’i’y’e Spring Salmon Studio, Susan Galick Fine Art Studio, The Pencil Studio, Artist Linda Muttitt, and Susan Falk — Artist.[2] Wisteria House in the Fort, Cranberry Country Inn B&B, Princess & the Pea B&B Langley, Fort Langley Camping, Vacation rental management, Lifty Life Hospitality.[3] Trading Post Brewing Taphouse & Eatery, The Fort Pub & Grill, Wendel’s Books and Cafe, Mangia E Scappa Italian Foods, Seasons Fine Supplements & Juice Bar, lelem’ Arts & Cultural Cafe, Little Donkey Food & Drink, Rail and River Bistro, SabaCafé & Bistro, Republica Roasters, Blacksmith Bakery, Beatniks Bistro, Planet 50’s Cafe, Into Chocolate, The Fort Wine Co., Bobs Growcery (Veggie Bob’s Kitchen Café), Lee’s Market, and Subway.[4] RE/MAX Award Winning Service, Royal LePage Sterling, RE/MAX — Dean Hooseman, RE/MAX — Gloria McGalliard, Royale LePage- Lisa Bakx, Mortgage Professional Nadia Causley, Ivory Accounting and Advisory Services (formerly de Verteuil & Company), Coast Capital Savings — Fort Langley, Ivory Planning Group, Stocking & Cumming, CA, The Paper Clip Bookkeeping, and Nadia ~ Mortgage Services, Stocking & Cumming — CPA, Business Accounting Langley.[5] Floralista Flower Studio, Niche Boutique Florals, Ivory Bridal — Dresses, Fort Lang Foto, Country Lane Antiques, and Rempel Mercantile.[6] The Fort Finery, Gallery Beads and Gifts, Chuckling Duckling Farm, Peridot Decorative Homewear, Floralista Flower Design Studio, Blueberry Meadows Interiors, Sxwimela Boutique and Giftstore, Watermelon Tree Baby & Kids, Kizmit Gift Gallery, Bella & Wren Design, Treasure Landing, Fort Langley Cyclery, The Fort Finery, Cranberries Naturally, Floralista Flower Studio, The Happy Kitchen, Aimee B Clothing And Accessories, Pacific Bottleworks Company, DDBooski Clothing, Dove Coterie, A Quilted Stitch, Bagheera Boutique, Roxanns Hats, Diana’s Sheepskins & Gifts, Roxanns of Fort Langley, Aimee B Clothing, I.D.

    "text": "Transcript: Episode 39: Could you fight a Meg?Access the episode page here.Travis Holland (00:24)welcome to Fossils and Fiction. Thank you so much to everyone engaging with us over the last fortnight. We’re going to discuss names for our mascots later on. There have been a huge number of suggestions. We’ve also got Paleo Pulse coming up pretty shortly, which is our news topic for the week and a special guest interview. But first, I’m going to say hi to my new co-host. She’s still settling into the chair. Alyssa, hi.Alyssa Fjeld (00:50)Travis, how are you doing today?Travis Holland (00:52)Yeah, pretty well. It’s a nice hot day to be surviving this heatwave we’re having up and down the East Coast, so…Alyssa Fjeld (00:59)It’s 40 degrees here in Melbourne today and I’m not sure that wildlife knows what to do.Travis Holland (01:04)No, the animals definitely struggle. saw some good advice that if you’re hot, if you are struggling in the heat, it’s a good idea to put some water out for birds and lizards and various other wildlife around the place and try and make sure they’re looked after. And we love wildlife on this podcast, even though we mostly talk about the dead ones.Alyssa Fjeld (01:22)Yeah, absolutely. I’ve actually put a little container of water so you can just fill a little tupperware with water and set it outside your house. Mine is currently being visited by a noisy miner. Yeah, yeah. I know, I can’t stop it.Travis Holland (01:33)Noisy Miner yeah. We don’t want to support those ones, but I suppose you can’t really be picky, which birds come along to the water. Also wouldn’t wish harm on them directly as such, but yeah, exactly right. Let’s start the episode proper with what I’ve now labeled Paleo Pulse. I think I’ve just sprung that on you now, but…Alyssa Fjeld (01:42)Yeah, unfortunately.Just make less of yourselves.Travis Holland (01:57)This is where we would discuss a recent paleo story. This one is by Barker et al out of the UK. And it looks at theropod diversity in the lower English Wealden group. Darren Naish is one of the co-authors as well. He’s quite well known around the place and particularly for research into this area.Alyssa Fjeld (02:16)Yeah, there’s a couple of really interesting things to me about this paper. And I just wanted to shout out to some people in my lab, Astrid O’Connor and Jake Kotevski who I talked about this article with in order to get a slightly better understanding of what’s kind of going on there. Theropods are not my wheelhouse, but they are very much Jake’s wheelhouse and Astrid is just a sweetheart. But there are two things that really stuck out to me as being interesting with this article.And the first is that these are fossils from the Cretaceous that are coming out of a location in the UK that does have dinosaur-bearing strata, but it has something in common with our dinosaur strata here in Australia. And that is the relative incompleteness of the animals they get out of there and the inventiveness that they have to exhibit in order to actually understand what they’ve gotten.So here in Australia, if you didn’t know, there are dinosaurs, and there are especially ones here in Victoria in the coast of Inverloch. And when we dig these dinosaurs up, they’re coming out of this deposit that really banged them up in the process of getting them deposited in the mud. So this really powerful river current was breaking these bones apart into little fragments. And that tends to be all we find here. So we have to get pretty creative in the ways that we analyze those bones.what we’re seeing is that these are not full dinosaur skeletons either. Rather, these are teeth. They’re just teeth. So the authors of this paper have had to come up with a really inventive way of using generative AI in order to explore what the different assemblages were represented by. And the other thing that I thought was really cool about this that ties into today’s guest star is that this is material showing something very peculiar going on. And it’s something that we see in the Hell Creek formation as well.but with a different group of animals. So in the Isle of Wight what they’re seeing is that there are an awful lot of medium sized predators as well as one spinosaurus, so a very large apex predators in this environment. But there are lots and lots of these mid, I don’t want to say mid tier, that implies I think that they’re shittier.Travis Holland (04:14)Well, we’re going to ask about you fighting them later, so ranking in terms of tiers might be great.Alyssa Fjeld (04:20)fair. So you’ve got like all of these animals that would be like I guess comparable to having like a bunch of bobcats and coyotes and all of these medium-sized predators in an environment and you start to have to ask yourself how is this environment supporting all of these different groups that have these high metabolic costs? And our guest Colin is going to talk a little bit about a similar phenomena that happens in the Hell Creek Formation.This is a U.S. deposit with super complete allosaurs and different sauropods. And what they see in the Hell Creek Formation, as Colin will talk about in a bit, is that you have an environment that is supporting a huge diversity of large-bodied sauropods. And the question you have to ask in that circumstance is, how? How are all of these delicious little grass creatures feeding, well not grass, it wouldn’t have been grass yet, leafy boys, let’s say.How are they being supported in their environment? And Colin has a lot to say that this is due primarily to where their necks are allowing them to feed in the canopy, which I didn’t know. That’s really cool.Travis Holland (05:23)So niche partitioning is really important. And as you were alluding to, in this case, they’re looking at theropods, so primarily the meat eaters. And I think the thinking was previously that the sort of received wisdom was that probably there was spinosaurids and oviraptorosaurian possibilities in that location. But now you have to also consider when finding teeth or finding skeletal remains that there aretyrannoraptoran, tyrannosaurid, dromaeosaurid as well. essentially a lot more meat eaters at this time and place than we might have understood previously. And as you say, how is the environment supporting that? If you imagine herds of tens of thousands of Triceratops, for example, as you were talking about in Hell Creek, roaming across the landscape or sauropods, how are they supported by the environment? Because you certainly couldn’t imagine that.in the modern day landscape.Alyssa Fjeld (06:19)It’s just, it’s so interesting because the more we learn about these animals as animals, the more they become almost familiar to us. And then you get these monkey wrenches that throw all of that into not contention, but it it illustrates, I think that as much as we learn about the past, it really was a very different place and had very different ecosystems.Travis Holland (06:42)And so it points to some of those interesting questions. What were the ecosystems actually like? What were the animals, you know, their food web relationships like or the trophic relationships like? Absolutely interesting. I think it’s probably then time to get onto the guest. So you’ve already mentioned his name. I learned so much from this interview. I did the interview editing. The guest goes into so much information about details of allosaurus and I was thinking, great, this is really interesting and fun.And then suddenly we get that switch to the sauropods you were talking about. And so he talks about scanning an apatosaurine during the research and the niche partitioning of all these sauropods as well. So introduce the guests for us a little bit and then we’ll jump into the interview.Alyssa Fjeld (07:22)Absolutely. Colin Boisvert is a vertebrate paleontologist who’s currently studying out of the University of Oklahoma after doing his master’s degree at the University of Utah, I believe. He is an absolutely fascinating researcher who’s looking at a mix of both allosaurs, which are the big meat-eating boys that you know and love, as well as apatosaurs. And some of that work was also co-produced by Melbourne’s own Jack Perkins, who is working at Melbourne Museum at the moment.the really interesting things that Colin has to say about dinosaurs are rivaled only by the really cool revelations that he has about finding your way as an early career researcher. I think it, while we’re springing acronyms, I think he really has the three P’s that drive a lot of early people in paleo, right? He’s got the passion. It’s super obvious talking to him that this is a man that could talk about dinosaurs day and night. And those are exactly the kinds of people that you want in paleo because it.often is that you might have curveballs thrown at you or you might lose funding and you really need that passion driving you to continue to reach for opportunities and do what you’re doing. And he also has that persistence that you need to do that as well. Some people say that having a PhD or getting a PhD is really more a test of stubbornness and I think that’s absolutely a case you can make. Colin really channels that beautifully into his research. I think he does a great job of explaining it himself.And he also has the third good quality, which is pure luck. Sometimes great opportunities will come your way. And if you do what Colin does and seize those opportunities with that passion and persistence, you’ll make the most of the opportunity you’ve been given. And I think Colin just does an excellent job of demonstrating all of those qualities really well.Travis Holland (09:03)Fantastic Alyssa. Well, thank you so much for going out and doing that interview. We’ll jump to it now.Alyssa Fjeld (09:12)It’s my second episode here and we are talking with the fantastic dinosaur man, Colin Boisvert who completed his undergraduate degree, I believe, in California and then his master’s degree at BYU in Utah and is now studying allosaurs at, was it Oklahoma, Oklahoma Uni?Colin Boisvert (09:33)Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences is the full title.Alyssa Fjeld (09:37)How’s life been? How’s Oklahoma?Colin Boisvert (09:39)Oklahoma’s all right. It’s, it’s interesting. I think it’s finally starting to get colder. So we’ll see how the winter compares to Utah and, life’s okay. Just, you know, chugging along and clinical anatomy and, learning about the human body.Alyssa Fjeld (09:53)that certainly sounds exciting and probably quite interesting as a comparison to what you’re doing with Dinosaur Anatomy. Jack Perkins was telling me a little bit about your project and he said that you’re currently working with Allosaurs, is that correct?Colin Boisvert (10:07)Yes, yeah, so I am working with Allosaurus. I don’t know how much I can say, but I mean, I’m an open book. Basically, Allosauridae, as of this moment, if you went out into Google Scholar, into the literature, you would see a surprising situation. We’ve had different species of Allosaurus described. As of 2020, and I have a funny story involving that one, Allosaurus jimmadseniof course, Allosaurus fragilis, had its neotype finally designated in, I believe it was December of last year, 2023. And then of course, Allosaurus europis described in 2006 from Portugal. And then of course, the ever classic, ever interesting, saurophaganax maximus is the last member of the clade Allosauridae, a clade that currently only exists during the late Jurassic period of Europe and North America. ButLike I said, as of today, if you went onto Google Scholar, and it could change in the future, hopefully, hopefully will. What’s really interesting is Allosaurus jimmadseni currently, Allosaurus europis, and then, well, specifically those two haven’t been phylogenetically placed into the family Allosauridae. We often see Allosaurus treated as a OTU, operational taxonomic unit.where it’s just the genus Allosaurus, and then of course they compare it usually, such as in Carrano et al. 2012 to Saurophaganax and show a sister relationship between those two. But what is the exact relationship between Fragilis jimmadseni, Europus, and Saurophaganax maximus? In a small way, that’s what part of my thesis hopes to work on a little bit, but I’m just getting started.So we’re just starting to figure it out or start to work on it. I cannot say figure it out, but start to work on it.Alyssa Fjeld (12:00)That sounds very-That sounds really exciting. Now for the people out there who may not remember the Allosaurus from their Jurassic Park franchise or other children’s media, Allosaurids are a group of theropod dinosaurs that are carnivorous. And that’s kind of the extent of my knowledge about them beyond that one of them was originally discovered by one of our bone wars champions, Mr. Marsh, if I remember correctly.Can you tell us a little bit more about what an Allosaurus is and Marsh as well, if you’d like?Colin Boisvert (12:29)Marsh.Yeah, Marsh did describe, I should know this, I’m getting better. Marsh did describe originally Allosaurus, however, the story, and Cope is involved too, because Cope found bones that would end up getting synonymized with Allosaurus, but initially were described as a different taxidermy. Now, Allosaurus has a difficult taxonomic history, because funny enough, we actually have to go past both of them to Joseph Leidywho found bones we think attributed to Allosaurus, or that we have been attributed to Allosaurus, but he thought they were from a new species of Pocleopleuron, which is a megalosaur, relative of in this case megalosaurus, the first described dinosaur. But they later were like, no, I don’t think this is Pocleopleuron, this is its own genus, so then it was redescribed as Antrodemus. And then you have Antrodemus valens.And then later we have Allosaurus fragilis among others. But then work in the 1920s by Charles Gilmore would show, it looks like Antrodemus and Allosaurus are just the same thing. And so it gets a little complicated there. And then there’s the fact that Chure discusses Allosaurus jimmadseni in his thesis that’s out there. But then the description would come in 2020.And then Allosaurus europaeus, first initially discussed in papers in 1999, the papers out in 2006. But really, the difficulty once again is with Allosaurus fragilis, because with Allosaurus fragilis, there’s the holotype, but the holotype is from some scrappy material that is, or scrappier material that’s in the Yale Peabody collections. And so therefore there was difficulty with, can we keep this holotype? And so that’s why there was a petition to describe in this case a neotype.or to designated neotype. And so in this case, USNMV 4734, which is at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History or the National Museum of Natural History is now the designated neotype for Allosaurus fragilis. And then of course, there are still, I think there were claims in the 1900s made that Antrodemus was valens. And along with Antrodemus, you haveAllosaurus atrox, labrosaurus, creasaurus. These are all animals that have been later synonymized with allosaurus, and I think specifically allosaurus fragilis, but they were around. Epanterias that was the one Cope named. And then of course you have even more recently allosaurus leukocyt described in 2014, which is part of, once again, the Yale Peabody collection. we really have a question. What is allosaurus fragilis?What is Allosaurus jimmadseni? And of course we know Allosaurus europaeus and saurophagonax, but what are they? How can we kind of constrict them and where are they all related? As to the other part of your question, Allosaurus is what we call a tetanuran which means stiff tail, as my memory serves correctly. Basically it’s a more derived clade of theropods. So we’re not including in this case, Ceratosaurus and Abellosaurs, but we are including Megalosaurs.and then allosaurs, and then we have all of coelurosauria which is basically, if it’s not a ceratosaur it’s not an early theropod, it’s not a coelophysoid, it’s not an allosaur or a megalosaur, then it’s probably a coelurosaur right? These include Tyrannosaurs, Megaraptorans, which I do believe are separate, but once again, phylogenetics, we gotta let it take its course, ornithomimids, deinonychosaurs, birds, therizinosaurs, right? A whole swath of different theropods. But so we have allosaurs.Allosaurus itself is distinguishable. They have some beautiful, beautiful bony crests on their lacrimal bones. They’re just gorgeous to behold and gorgeous to hold. I’ve held a couple Allosaurus lacrimals in my hand. Otherwise, Allosaurus, in this case, had three functional fingers, big claws. we think could potentially run, you know,It’s not a lightning fast runner. We’re not talking a cheetah. This is an animal that probably more would have ambushed its prey. It could keep a pace for maybe a short distance, otherwise long tail, S-shaped neck, decently powerful jaws and based on research, potentially a very powerful neck, but as of course biomechanical models are always being updated.Sharp teeth, right? These teeth were designed for slicing flesh versus T-Rexes, which are designed to just crush you, bone and all. Yeah, so claws, jaws, and a terrifying body. And then there are claims, we can’t necessarily state this yes or no, maybe Allosaurus was gregarious, whether that’s probably in this case more an opportunistic gang sort of situation versus a traditional mammalian pack or family unit.but word’s still out.Alyssa Fjeld (17:21)I saw some literature indicating as well that they can unhinge their jaws quite wide. Do you support that hypothesis?Colin Boisvert (17:29)I don’t think I’ve looked into enough of the biomechanical models regarding that research in order to give a solid yay or nay. Now from what I’ve heard, Allosaurus does have an extra joint in its lower jaw. And so I believe from what I’ve learned that that lower joint would help with expanding the mouth. So I think it is possible. I don’t know if it could fully unhinge.but it could definitely go for, I think, a wide gape and potentially start to expand the jawAlyssa Fjeld (17:59)very useful if I wanted to consume a whole ornithopod or other delicious creature from the time. So you said there were a couple of new things in the world of allosaur research and you talked about a 2020 paper that you have a fun story about. Can you tell us what’s new and maybe your funny story?Colin Boisvert (18:17)Yeah, of course. So 2020. 2020, we didn’t know it, I didn’t know it, along with a big year in general with a lot of interesting events. 2020 would also be the year that I’m walking into my microbiology class at University of California Davis. You know, it’s a Friday morning, I’m tired. I got class all day. And I’m like, all right, let’s just get through this. Or actually, it wasn’t microbiology, was cell biology.It’s like, right, let’s get through this cell biology class, because I struggled with cell biology. I had to really, really work at it, and it was a difficult class for me. And of course, you you try to keep your ears to the ground, and you got Discord, and you got Facebook, your other social media popping up with news articles about a new carnivore discovered that, you know, blah, blah, blah. yeah, I think it was the classic, right? New carnivore discovered relating to T. rex. According to popular media sometimes,every new theropod is a relative of T. rex, isn’t entirely inaccurate. It’s just, you know, it’s like, well, there are some things that are actually closer to T. rex that are other tyrannosaurs. And then there’s, hey, this is an allosaur. How about you say new theropod related to allosaurs or, you know, let’s bring in Jurassic world, new theropod related to giganotosaurus, right? So, but it’s always, cause you see these articles all the time, they discover and describe a new abelisaur, something that is very distantly related to T. rex. And they’re like,new theropod from Africa related to T. rex discovery. And there’s been a few times where I’ve seen that and gone like, wait, did they find a Tyrannosaur in Africa finally? And then it’s like, no, it’s an abelisaur. I need to stop falling for this. So I had my doubts when I see this article and there was a piece of paleo art with it, but I clicked the article and I think I remember swearing because I was like, holy.Because I read it and it’s saying, yeah, University of Utah just announced or they’re about to announce today prior to their Dino Fest, an annual event they have at the Natural History Museum of Utah and Salt Lake City. They’re about to drop, they described a new species of Allosaurus and I clicked the link and follow it to Peer J and start trying to look through the article, but I was just ecstatic the rest of the morning. I forget what my lecture was about. I just kept thinking, yo, we got a new species of Allosaurus from North America. This is amazing.And especially in this case, a very famous specimen, MOR693, otherwise known to the public at times as Big Al, which was the star of a documentary, Allosaurus, a Walking with Dinosaurs special, or the Ballad of Big Al, is actually a member of this new species. It’s considered a referred specimen to Allosaurus jimmadseni. So that was just really cool to think that it’s like, whoa, there’s a new Allosaurus on the scene and it’s already got a, I mean, it has a holotype from Dinosaur National Monument and it also had, I’d say, a spokes.spokesmember with Big Al. So that was really cool. Even more recently, we had Meraxes gigas, a carcharodontosaur. It’s always exciting when we get a new carcharodontosaur And especially with Meraxes, it’s very interesting because of the whole forelimb. They see forelimb shortening happening similar to tyrannosaurs. And so it’s a question of why is this happening? And it seems now maybe this is a general trend.across multiple bodies of large-bodied theropod dinosaurs, this is occurring, especially because just very recently, we have new referred material to Taurovenator which was considered earlier on, a dubious carcharodontosaur genera, especially because was based on the holotype was a post-orbital, but now we have extra material. It does look like it’s different, and it also shows this four-limb shortening. So it’s like, okay, seems to be a common trend.This is very curious, you know, what’s going on here. And along with that, we also have a Metriacanthosaur that was just described earlier this year in, I believe it was in August. it’s from Kyrgyzstan and that’s really exciting because based on when it’s found and where it’s found, would…be amazing in my book if we could get a biogeographical study on this animal because there seems to be this trend, and maybe it’s just me, there seems to be this trend popping up where we’re seeing that with regard to the allosauroids story, you have Asfaltovenator from South America, which is kind of the, wait, how did that get there? I’m confused. But otherwise, the rest of the earliest allosauroids and the earliest Metriacanthosaurs are all in Asia.It kind of seems like they’re spinning a loop in Asia and they just keep pumping out new genera and that’s where they start. And then we see eventually a strand, I’m gonna call it, I don’t know, that’s technically not true, a branch. A branch eventually leaves and gets to, we have Metriacanthosaurus in Europe around 160 million years ago. And now between that species 160 million years ago, a few other Metriacanthosaur such as in this case, Sinraptor, Yangshuanosaurus, which are around the same age.and a few maybe older ones and older Allosauroids We now have right, I would say, about the same time and also in the middle, you have our new genera from Kyrgyzstan. So it kind of seems like we can say, all right, there was definitely a migration from Asia to Europe. And then of course, once we get to Europe with allosauridae that’s a nexus point. The late Jurassic was a very interesting time, it seems, for allosauroids because we have, in this case currently, the last of the Metriacanthosaurs.We also get potentially one of the earliest, if not the earliest, Carcharodontosaurus with Lusovanator in Portugal, as well as we have our Portugal Allosaurus species, Allosaurus europaeus. And then obviously from there, will also then later have, or later or potentially at the same time, have Allosaurus in North America. So were they diversifying in Europe and then spreading out or is it maybe the oppositeAlyssa Fjeld (24:02)Very, very interesting, especially thinking about, I suppose, what we get here in Australia where there’s very little, I assume, and Jake Kotevski can come for me if I’m wrong about this, but my understanding is that the theropods we get here exhibit very little forelimb shortening, so their arms are not retreating as we think about the typical T. rex arms.And it’s interesting as well that these animals are doing this diversification in the Jurassic. I think it’s pretty common knowledge now that most of the dinosaurs that we feature in Jurassic Park are not actually from the Jurassic. So you could, in theory, then, have your Allosaur as your major predator, and that would be pretty exciting.Colin Boisvert (24:42)Yes, and equally terrifying in terms of the media. Before T. rex took a major step on the scene, a lot of times, I think even in literary work, Allosaurus was used once it was discovered as the big terrifying dinosaurian predator. It was top of the heap. It has a major starring role in The Lost World by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.with one of my favorite adaptations being the 2001 A &E movie. so yeah, so Allosaurus is a terrifying predator. It also got a spotlight, which was amazing in Battle at Big Rock with the Jurassic Series.Alyssa Fjeld (25:23)just to backtrack a little bit, you mentioned that this was something, these new discoveries were starting to come out even when you were in your undergraduate degree at UC Davis. And I think that’s a pretty typical story for a lot of us in paleo. This is something that is an interest that has followed us for a significant portion of our lives. It sounds like that’s something that would be true for you, a long life long interest in dinosaurs, specifically allosaurs or has it changed?Colin Boisvert (25:49)no, it hasn’t really changed. I think it became defined. So I’ve loved dinosaurs since I was a little kid and I grew up in one of the most, I want to say interesting places to love paleontology, which is I grew up in Silicon Valley, AKA the tech capital of the world. So, you everyone’s looking to the future and Colin’s looking to the past. the, the kind of biggest and mostNatural history-esque like museum that I grew up with was the California Academy of Sciences, which is an amazing museum, but they even pride themselves on when it comes to natural history, they’re not a standard natural history museum like we see in the movies and we visit in places such as Utah and New York and such. They focused more on the natural and then the history is kind of part of the background in terms of them describing processes such as evolution and how that works and adaptive radiation.Sure, you’re greeted in the front of the Cal Academy, the new building as of 2008 by a T. rex. But besides that T. rex and a few other mentions of fossils, it’s a lot more learning about, you know, biodiversity in the oceans, right? They have a huge exhibit on coastal environments, especially because California is a coastal state and, you know, our coral, not coral reefs, sorry, kelp forests are very important. They have a rainforest dome. They have a hall on Africa, which does have a little bit on hominid evolution.So I grew up Silicon Valley, right, in a very different place, but I’ve loved dinosaurs since I was a kid. I was always trying to talk to everyone I knew about dinosaurs. It oftentimes became a lecture. So it was very difficult. It was in high school as I was starting to figure out, you know, where did I want to apply to college? My dad and I did a trip to the University of Wyoming and it was there that I really got my first glimpse talking to them regarding, you know, how undergraduate and future work with.paleontology works that I learned, you they said, well, you know, when people tend to specialize, right, you can say, I want to study dinosaurs, but then people usually study specific type of dinosaur or use a specific group of dinosaurs as a case study with specific methods. So that’s where I really started to think, well, what did I want to study? Since I was a little kid, I had loved, and it still is my favorite dinosaur, Giganotosaurus, and that is probably mainly because of Nigel Marvin.and his Chased by Dinosaurs special, which I watched so many times as a kid. And technically it features Mapusaurus that we now know, but at the time they thought it was Giganotosaurus and it’s a beautiful special, it’s 30 minutes, amazing. I’ve actually talked over COVID, funny enough, Nigel Marvin, he basically put on his website, you can still do it. You could basically pay him to have a Zoom call with him. So I was like, yes, please.So I talked with that man and told him what I was studying and said, I loved everything you worked on in the early 2000s. You know, I’m a huge fan. was a great conversation. He’s, he’s an amazing person. Super nice. But, so I realized I wanted to study allosauroids. And so I came to college and, college was really, it was a great experience, obviously, even in the end where things got crazy cause of COVID, but college was eyeopening where I learned, right. And I can’t believe I didn’t see this coming.Shocker. Not the biggest fish in the pond when it comes to what you know about paleontology. mean, obviously I had professors and I knew I did not know more than my professors, but even among just the other undergraduates and of course the graduate students, right? I don’t want to say I learned my place, but I kind of learned to, in my case, stop talking and just listen and see what I can learn from others. And I learned a lot.I I became quieter and I didn’t necessarily voice my theories all the time. I tried to, I think, become more calculating in terms of, you know, I think we can make this claim based on this evidence. And I think that’s especially reflected towards the end of my time at UC Davis. Yes, I rushed it a little bit more and I should have taken a longer period of time, but one of my favorite things was in an ecology class I was taking, I ended up writing on one of my favorite subjects.from one of my favorite paleontologists, Scott Sampson, right? He wrote an amazing article in the Scientific American that came out in 2014 that basically just asked the question and discussed a situation regarding, all right, Laramidia, roughly, as I remember, half the size of Australia at anywhere from four to seven million square, I think miles in this case, but similar in size to Australia.and a fifth of the size of Africa. Africa today features, I think they said, about a half dozen mega herbivores, herbivores over one ton in weight. Laramidia, you know, anywhere from 80 to we’ll say 70 million years ago, and just for ballpark 75, has over two dozen. What is happening? Why is there an over saturation of so many mega herbivorous dinosaurs in Campanian Laramidia, right?This shouldn’t be possible. This shouldn’t be able to fit the environment. And so that ecology class allowed me to really dive deep. And I kind of did a lit review term paper where I basically said, okay, here’s the question. Can we use the current literature to try to explain this? It turns out we might be able to. And with regard to the histology of the prey versus the histology of the predators, AKA our predators, especially tyrannosaurs, were getting to adult size if they made it.At about the same time that our herbivores were getting into their older age, combined with surprising sources of food from potential bark to crustaceans that maybe our animals weren’t necessarily just always eating the softest plants, they would go after other sources of food to supplement their diet. And there seems to be kind of a, as we often expect in nature, a multi-factor mechanism for how we can explain why so many large bodied mega herbivoresHerbivorous dinosaurs are surviving in Campanian Laramidia Now obviously time is a factor. They weren’t all living at exactly the same place and time, but we have multiple quarries where we know, all right, we have at least one ceratopsian and at least one chasmosaur, potentially one lambiasaurine and one saurolophine as well as an ankylosaur and a pachycephalosaur and potentially a few others. So we know there are environments where we have a lot of these animals. And then we have multiple of these.that are at roughly the same age? So it was a great question. So that was, I think, really important for me. My professor said, yeah, your paper’s kind of a little, you know, arm wavy in terms of, I think, drawing attention, but hey, sometimes we need those studies to get people’s attention and say, hey, I know we’re all slowly coming here, and there have been a ton of people doing amazing work with this that are showing that there’s definite niche partitioning happening. And then we have, of course, you know, the alternate diets.and then we could probably bring histology into it and other factors as well, such as maybe what we’re seeing is these animals could have had lower population demographics. So there are so many of these animals, but maybe they didn’t have massive herds. Now they definitely had to have some mass, because we know we have a centrosaurus bone bed with over 10,000 individuals in Canada, but maybe they all weren’t like that. Maybe some were rarer than others in terms of population dynamics. So that was an important thing that I think helped me.learn a bit more about the scientific method and learn to structure my ideas.Alyssa Fjeld (33:15)have several thoughts about this. First, crabs, how exciting, my gosh. That is like, detrophagy in, so the eating of crustaceans and other hard-shelled mollusks in dinosaurs would be thrilling for me as an arthropod person. We love to see a crushing plate. I’m not saying that they had crushing plates, was, now I’m just imagining a sauropod with like a Port Jackson style mouth going and I want that to be real, so.Colin Boisvert (33:17)HahahaI think it was crabs, otherwise it might’ve been gastropods. All I know is it was invertebrates and it was surprising that when I read it, I was like, I did not expect that, especially from these herbivores.Alyssa Fjeld (33:52)Next thing you know, we’ll be finding evidence for the garlic butter recipes in the Cretaceous and Jurassic as well. My next thought is, I think it’s really interesting that you also grew up in an area that did not really have a lot of natural history in terms of the museums and other readily available public institutions. Tennessee does have some absolutely fantastic museums and we also have north of Maine.Colin Boisvert (34:15)ETSU.Alyssa Fjeld (34:17)Yes, ETSU has a fantastic, I believe it’s Cenozoic Animal Deposit known as the Gray Fossil Site where you can find just a fantastic array of very well preserved mammals and other sorts of things. the closest museum to me was a children’s museum that had like a PVC pipe you could pump air through to simulate the sound of a parasaurolophus office honking.And I think there’s that element of mystery that exists within the context you grow up in that can be very motivating. And I think as well, you have the other three key ingredients that I see time and time again with other paleos. You had the creativity, drive to yap about it. I think the yapping tends to be, we’re all into the yapping. And then you got the tempering. So the ability to figure out where and when your creativity and yourcapacity to convey that science becomes the most important and when it’s time to listen to others to help you resharpen those arguments. So I think that’s really interesting. I wanted to ask a little bit about your journey after you graduated from UC Davis. So I know you did a master’s degree. Would you like to talk a little bit about that?Colin Boisvert (35:28)Temperance I’ve had to learn firsthand. An important story I didn’t mention was when I was a middle schooler, some family and I actually went up north into Oregon and basically checked out John Day fossil beds. And along with that visited fossil Oregon where behind their high school you can dig for plant fossils. And that was really kind of a first experience for me with digging and where I learned a lesson the hard way because Itook my rock hammer and just whacked in the hillside, both thinking, I’m gonna find the dinosaur. They say you can’t find dinosaurs here. I’ll dig deep enough to find it, as well as, I probably broke a few, I did, broke a few plant fossils along the way. And I actually found, I think a lot of the plant fossils I ended up taking with me in the refuse pile from other people. But I learned through that, I’m then visiting a specimen where they showed how a hyper-enthused,What’s the right word here? Hyper-enthused person who ended up finding and then I think donating a specimen, as I remember from the exhibit, to John Day fossil beds in the process kind of damaged the specimen and how patience was really important in this field. The other thing, funny enough, it’s slightly gotten better. We also have a children’s discovery museum in San Jose and it actually now houses, I forget what year it was, I was in high school though.They found along the river that runs through our town the bones of a Colombian mammoth that died in the area and now its fossils are in that museum.Colin Boisvert (36:54)I was applying to grad school and I decided to apply to more programs and I’m glad I did. And I applied to a mixture of PhD and master’s programs. and, and along with that, I was applying to internships and what ended up happening is out of, applied to nine programs. I got into BYU, and I also got into an internship at the Mammoth site in Hot Springs, South Dakota.Before I then came home, quickly packed up my stuff and moved out to Provo, Utah for my masters. So the internship was amazing. We went to so many cool places, checked out a lot of cool things. I was an education intern, so it literally was my job to yap to people about, here’s why paleontology is important, here’s what we’re discovering at this site. It was a sinkhole.I even wrote a parody song about it, it’s beautiful. And then I started my masters and my masters, I had a chance, I could have described a specimen of Allosaurus that they had, or yeah, a specimen there. But instead I ended up working on, there’s a specimen, BYU 18531. It is an Apatosaurine.that is from the Brushy Basin member of the Morris Formation which is a Lake Jurassic rock unit here in North America. This specimen was found down south near Moab, Utah. So right near Arches and Canyonlands National Park. This specimen was originally discovered by a local rock shop owner named Lynn Ottinger and his son, Sonny. And then they reported it to BYU, who got permission from BLM because it was on BLM land.And then BYU excavated the specimen between 2007 to 2009. And that’s a funny thing because people would always ask me sometimes when I gave presentations on this specimen, did you get to help dig it up? And I was like, no, I was in fifth grade. So I did not help dig it up. That would have been very interesting though as a fifth grader doing that. But this specimen was unique. And I’m actually going to be speaking about this on Wednesday for the Moab chapter of the Utah Friends of Paleontology on my thesis.The specimen is relatively complete with an almost complete neck. apatosaurines generally have, they have 15 neck bones, 15 cervical vertebrae. They found C2 through C15. We were only missing the atlas or C1. These bones were relatively complete with minimal distortion. So it provided a chance to ask the question, how did this animal hold its neck? So basically I did a study looking intothe what we call OMP, Osteological Neutral Pose, So how did, how might this animal potentially held its neck? That’s what it was. It was focused on obviously the neck biomechanics. We wanted to potentially try to get range of motion in there as well, but that did not happen in the timeframe. So in the future, that’ll have to be done.So it was still really interesting. This project involved, we had to do photogrammetry for cervical two through cervical 13. We ended up using, at the end of my first year, they purchased a Faro scanner, which is a 3D surface scanner. And that’s how we would get models of dorsal two through dorsal four, because this animal has almost all 10 of its dorsals. Now you’re asking, Collin, you forgot C14 and C15 and dorsal one. What are you doing? I didn’t forget.those bones were still attached by a matrix. They were left together. Whereas every other bone, because once again, this was an articulated neck, was separated from each other. We took those three bones to an industrial CT scanner down in Southern California, NSI North Star Imaging, where we put these bones into an industrial CT scanner in order to get CT scans of them and then use CT segmentation in order to figure outWhat do these bones look like? And, you know, in this case, how far apart are they from each other in terms of intertubal spacing? For reference, this industrial CT scanner, the average hospital CT scanner uses about 0.1 million electron volts. We bombarded this specimen with 6 million electron volts and the scan took 30 hours.Alyssa Fjeld (40:51)gosh.Colin Boisvert (40:51)Yeah, but so that’s how we got models and then I did CT segmentation or as I like to call it the world’s worst form of adult coloring into yeah, took almost six weeks and then we had these models. Now for a lot of these models, not all of them due to time constraints, we realized, wow, they’re not really distorted but there is still some distortion due to diagenetic alteration as well as human preparation.For cervical 3-3, cervical 13, we try to digitally restore the bones as much as possible around problematic areas, especially focused on the, in this case, condyle or the cup at the front, the cotyle, the cup on the back, the ball on the front, and then the pre and post-sci hypotheses basically faces where these bones are articulating with each other. So we tried to take these digitally restored models in order to put them through an animation program known as Autodesk Maya, as well as we used scale.3D prints from our engineering lab on campus to physically rig a dinosaur neck and therefore compare virtually and physically how did this animal potentially hold its neck? And what we found is, right, well, this animal was actually kind of holding its neck, not necessarily straight, not in the classic S shape. What we found is it had a transition point at dorsal one and then it basicallywas a sinusoidal drooping neck, so it went up and then down. So, but generally it was down for at least this specific animal. Now, I’d like to preface from what I’ve seen in the literature and what I, I think I have come to the same conclusion based on the literature and seeing other dinosaur necks, especially other sauropod necks. I don’t think it’s necessarily a one fits all model when it comes to sauropod necks. This mamenchisaurus on my shirt probably has a different neck posture.than the, I think it’s Argentinosaurus or Diplodocus on the back of my shirt. Different clades probably had different neck postures and potentially even different intraclade neck postures. Who’s to say that Diplodocus had the same neck posture as Apatosaurus? I mean, my thesis gets into a core issue, another large issue of what I like to call CMSI, the Coeval Morrison sauropod issue. It’s not a murder crime scene that we are.technically studying dead bones. But how do so many large-bodied long-necked animals multiple times larger than an elephant live in the same place at the same time? This is nowhere more prevalent than at Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry, which is a BYU locality where there is evidence of at least six different sauropod genera at this one single quarry.It has Apatosaurus, Camarasaurus, Brachiosaurus, Supersaurus, Diplodocus, and Haplocanthosaurus, and then potentially Barosaurus So at least six genera of sauropods in one locality. Okay, if we have six animals that are, in this case, even multiple times larger than our mega herbivorous Campanian dinosaurs, our ornithischians,And there are still ornithischians in the environment. There’s gotta be some kind of extreme niche partitioning or other multiple variables for how these animals are able to live at the same place at the same time. And neck posture is part of that because neck posture gets into, well, based on how this animal is holding its neck and how far it can move its neck, that can tell us a little bit about the feeding envelope, which is work that has been done by scientists such as Ken Stevens. And then, you know, from feeding envelope, you can get an idea of, this one has this feeding envelope and this one has this feeding envelope. And so you can try to figure out, all right.How are all these different sauropods feeding? Of course, getting back to it, that kind of requires that you have a lot of nice necks and we don’t always have a lot of nice neck fossils for sauropods. So we have to use what we can to figure out what’s possible.Alyssa Fjeld (44:37)fascinating. I can’t imagine an environment with that many large herbivores in it. So you’re saying that it’s essentially that the necks are allowing them to vegetation at different heights within the canopy. Would that be correct?Colin Boisvert (44:48)Yes, I would say so. These animals are likely feeding at different heights and even there’s evidence, right, that Apatosaurus, even if Apatosaurus, let’s say, wasn’t feeding high in the trees, there’s evidence biomechanical models to indicate it might have been able to rear up. And so if it is able to rear up, in this case, kind of like a kangaroo, maybe balancing on its tail a little bit, this animal then might have been able to reach high into the trees occasionally.to get its tall greens, but for the most part, maybe it wasn’t always doing that, especially if its neck posture is further down. there’ve already been some claims made that like Camarasaurus was maybe kind of feeding in the middle, mid-browsing height, brachiosaurus was a high browser, and then claims that animals such as diplodocus and apatosaurus might’ve been feeding lower, so.Alyssa Fjeld (45:19)you go you goit makes sense that you would have different neck posturing in this really diverse group. Like I think this is something that a lot of people don’t necessarily, I think it’s something that if you said it to them they would go, yes that makes sense, but sauropods, theropods, the diversity of dinosaurs even within these familiar groups is tremendous. The number of different species we get and the different life habits, it’s very fascinating.Colin Boisvert (45:57)In terms of the whole actually, you different sauropods had different neck postures. Well, you definitely get that if you read a lot of sauropod neck poses, but what I was finding with my thesis, especially at the end is,In terms of, we had a hypothesis, we rejected that hypothesis, and we found a neck that was like this. So in terms of what was this animal likely eating on? Well, I had to really go into the literature and expand because you have to start using other pieces of evidence that are also independently pointing or providing evidence for a similar conclusion, right? So there’s evidence that a close relative of Patosaurus, Nigerosaurus, has a really high tooth replacement rate. So dinosaurs, unlike mammals, are constantly replacing their teeth throughout their lifetime.And we’re seeing in some diplotocoids, such as Nigerosaurus, that they’re really replacing their teeth very rapidly. Like we’re talking, a tooth gets replaced, I think it was between every 15 to 30 days a tooth is replaced. And so one of the ideas is, well, why are they replacing their teeth so fast? Maybe it’s because they’re eating abrasive vegetation. What usually in this case is abrasive, a lot of ground growing vegetation. Now you have to remember though, in the late Jurassic, we don’t, as far as we know, have grasses.which are the general abrasive vegetation we might think of today, especially with horses. So in this case, these animals are feeding on other ground-growing vegetation that’s wearing down their teeth super quick. that using phylogenetics, this apatasaurine, BYU-18531, also might’ve had quick replacement rate on its teeth. That coupled with a apatasaurus’ muzzle, or kind of its snout, is a little bit broader compared to some of its relatives. And Nigerasaurus has a very broad snout, and in mammals, a broadening of the muzzlehas been correlated with kind of being a grazer, combine that with, you know, cranial biomechanics, which indicate diplodocoids, likely were able to rake food in because they had non-occluding dentition, and so that allowed more translational movement, but they had weaker bite forces compared to other animals, and that weaker bite force may have helped with eating, in this case, vegetation that’s lower to the ground and likely softer versus hard woody material.you kind of start to paint a picture that, all right, maybe all these things are adding up that this animal was feeding on one specific area of its environment. And then the same thing for other sauropods. I people, I think with Camarasaurus and brachiosaurus keep coming back to that conclusion that those types of dinosaurs seem to be feeding more in the mid to high browsing range. And I don’t think anyone has really made a claim yet that Camarasaurus.the most common sauropod in the Morrison, so we have a lot of them, was grazing on the ground.Alyssa Fjeld (48:33)fascinating. That is so much good information about sauropods and I can’t wait to hear what you end up publishing from it. I’m sure we are all looking forward to that. I just wanted to ask a couple more questions quickly before we wrap up. So the first question I have for you is Jack Perkins at Melbourne Museum who was telling me, and I know guys I say the R in Melbourne, it sounds worse if I don’t.Jack Perkins mentioned that you guys are working on something and that you didn’t mind giving us a little sneak peek. Is this also to do with dinosaurs?Colin Boisvert (49:03)This does also have to do with dinosaurs, yeah. So what Jack is referring to is last year at SVP, I gave a presentation on a project that actually started with some coding classes I took at BYU. So, hypercarnivorous megatherapods, theropods over a thousand kilograms in weight. We have in this case roughly five clades that contain members who would be considered hypercarnivorous megatherapods.These are some of the most charismatic theropods out there. People know them. People sometimes love them. Other times they don’t love them. They include, in this case, tyrannosaurids, which includes our famous T. rex, right? One of the most classic examples. It also includes megaraptorans, or at least megaraptorans, and I, we treated for this project megaraptorans as coelurosaurs but separate from tyrannosaurids.And we have a few Megaraptorans that are definitely over thousand kilograms. And they are kind of a large, medium to large body predator in the environments they live in. Then we also have now Ceratosaurians, right? Ceratosaurians such as especially Abelosaurs, right?Then you have megalosauroids, which includes spinosaurus as well as megalosaurus. And finally, last but never least, allosauroids which includes our allosaurus, our metriacanthosaurus, our carcharodontosaurs our neovenators such as neovenator. So we have these five clades and I initially just asked the question, okay,Where in time and space do we see these clades coexisting with each other? Can we start to a story of who’s coexisting with who, when, and what’s going on? And as we started to plot these things out, where we gave each of the species initially a temporal value and a spatial value, so a single landmass, we started to see some interesting trends in terms of where things were popping up, who was popping up with who, and what places were they popping up.And so a lot of the earlier work when it was focused on this temporal spatial overlap found there seemed to be a trend of earlier temporal spatial overlap in the kind of Northern Hemisphere and Europe, which we treated as a Mesozoic ecotone or place where you have faunal mixing from multiple communities, especially because Europe, we see classic fauna from the North and we see fauna from the South, especially in the Lake Cretaceous where you get titanosaurs and abelosaurs mixing with hadrosaurs andpotential new ceratopsians. Europe seems to be this faunal mixing pot. So that’s why we said, well, we’re going to treat Europe as different from the rest of the Northern hemisphere, or in this case, Asia and America. And then this trend was followed by latter Southern temporal spatial overlap. As we started digging into the literature more, we started to see some trends regarding potential, the size classes as defined by Holtz’s 2021 paper between these animals.coupled with, along with that, know, all right, who was overlapping with who and who doesn’t overlap with who, we have yet to find, as far as I know, a confirmed abelisaur or a valid abelisaur genus with a confirmed valid tyrannosaur genus. So abelisaur and tyrannosaurs don’t seem to be mixing. Megaraptorans and tyrannosaurs also, I believe, they live at certain times near each other, but we haven’t found them, to my knowledge, confirmed in the same environment yet.So we had some interesting questions and we were able to use some of the literature to try to help explain some of the trends we saw on the data. Now the project has morphed a little bit, so we’re more looking at kind of the relationships regarding those size classes and less temporal spatial overlap. But we’re still trying to get a story kind of regarding the, right, in terms of who lives with who, what is going on as these five different clades evolve and diversify?Because there’s a lot of evidence, one specific example is there seems to be this evidence that with regard to potential temporal spatial overlap, near the end of the Cretaceous, we see abelisaurus and we see megaraptorans both in South America. However, what the literature discusses seems to start to happen is there kind of starts to see, there starts to be this split where you have abelisaurus in the North in Brazil.Alyssa Fjeld (52:42)That is fascinating.Colin Boisvert (53:07)and then in Patagonia into the south you have megaraptorans but you don’t have them in each other’s environment. So it seems they almost kind of split the continent a little bit in half and say, okay, you stay on your side and I stay on mine. That way they’re the, least the hypercarnivorous predatory ones aren’t competing with each other. But of course, you know, the word is still out on if that is exactly happening. It’s just there have been several papers discussing, well, maybe there seems to be this kind of.difference in the fauna between north and south South America.Alyssa Fjeld (53:36)You know, they’ve split the continent evenly between those who skipped leg day and those who’ve skipped arm day, which is of course the best way to divide yourself up. I have one more question for you before we wrap up.Colin Boisvert (53:40)HaAlyssa Fjeld (53:46)You can choose your own adventure here. either I would like to hear you tell me about the worst example of either a sauropod or an allosaur that you’ve seen in popular media so you can have a little rant if you’d like. Or if you’d like to tell us about some media you recommend, if there’s a particularly good example of how these animals are discussed and displayed.Colin Boisvert (54:07)I’ll go with the positive versus, you know, in this case, just disparaging one type of media. I think in terms of what really works, it’s still revolutionary for the times. A lot of the early 2000s work with the Walking with series is fantastic for any type of prehistoric animal, because from some of the classic lines that stick with you toAlyssa Fjeld (54:12)Yeah. There.Colin Boisvert (54:32)to the CGI, the stories that were told, we got realistic animals, animals that fought, that died, that tried to breathe, that tried to survive, right? The predator did not always win. We can see that with Big Al, who literally, MOR693 in that series kept getting injuries from different points throughout its life. I believe the total now is up to 20 pathologies on one single skeleton of an allosaur.So it’s really interesting and they treated it that way, right? As they put, it’s called, Big Al represents a frozen moment in the fast and furious life of a carnivorous dinosaur, as I remember the line correctly. And so these documentaries were fantastic. One that has especially stuck with me, and it’s difficult because you mentioned you’re from Tennessee and this documentary relates to both of us, but it alsodoesn’t really touch on either of our state’s Mesozoic history is when dinosaurs roamed America. This was narrated by John Goodman, who people might recognize as the voice of Sully from Monsters, Inc. And so to just hear Sully very sometimes grimly and just kind of very intense give lines such as, there’s one more surprise in store, mom. Or for the male, there’s always tomorrow.It was a fantastic documentary that also told some amazing stories, treated these animals, once again, almost as if we went out and filmed them on the plains of Africa or the Great Plains of North America today. It didn’t try to tell gruesome, terrifying stories. You had underdogs, had evolutionary underdogs who would grow up. We had other animals who hit their prime and then had their time and were done.And so these were some really great documentaries. Otherwise, mean, I also, it’s specific to the Maastrichtian but Prehistoric Planet does a really good job with a lot of the science it discusses and the animals, how they act and behave, and some of the science that went into the program and some of the scientists who get to discuss, you know, what went into the program there.Alyssa Fjeld (56:44)I think that’s a really, like you’ve made a really good point as well because we often, I think that when we look to media like Jurassic Park to portray dinosaurs, right, they are fiction stories that are trying to convey other things. It’s not necessarily about treating these animals as animals. They’re allegorical, they are mysterious, they’re meant to be, you know.bad guys to some extent. So it’s interesting when we do get docu-series that treat them as living animals and it’s I think important as paleontologists to keep that aspect in mind and treat them as things that would have lived and done all of these things, eating, procreating, much like animals today.So that, I would agree. think that those are all fantastic pieces of media and I feel very relieved to hear that the Allosaurs in those were depicted well, so I can now continue to rely on those as my source of information beyond yourself. I do want to thank you for a interview and so much amazing information about sauropods, Allosaurs, and everything in between.Where can our listeners find you on social media?Colin Boisvert (57:53)On Twitter, I think it’s @ColinBoisvert1 and I believe on Instagram it’s @ColinBoisvert54 You type my name, you should see my face, it definitely looks like me. In fact, I think my Insta page, if I remember correctly, is me, funny enough, holding a cast of an Allosaurus Jimmadseni skull. So people will say, yeah, it’s that guy.Alyssa Fjeld (58:15)It definitely is.so do give Colin a look, give him a follow, and keep up with his work. It sounds like there’s plenty of exciting stuff in the pipeline for our listeners to turn to.Travis Holland (58:29)so that was such a great chat with Colin He really talked a lot about that thing we discussed of how many big herbivores you can have living in one location Which is also one of the puzzles in that English theropod discovery I learned so much from that chat. I thinkYou know, he could talk all day or for weeks without a break by the sounds of things and I could listen.Alyssa Fjeld (58:50)Yeah, absolutely. And he was so patient with my needing to record while I was in the US on my museum trip and bopping around New York. He really tolerated the background noise, which I hope our listeners will as well. Yeah, it was just a fascinating chat. And I’m so glad that he came on the show. I hope you guys will continue to follow him on his adventures in paleo.Travis Holland (59:10)Let’s have a chat now about naming our fantastic mascots for the podcast. These were designed just to remind people these were designed by Zev Landes who is a fantastic artist, paleo artist. And also he just creates all sorts of other art. We’ll put Zev’s details in the show notes so can go and check him out. And we had so many good responses to this. I was like…I was nervous as to with anyone would even respond, but so many people did. We put this up as stories on our individual stories on Instagram and on the Fossils and Fiction Instagram account and also on Blue Sky and the responses just poured in from all over the place. So, paleoastroid on Instagram, which is Astrid O’Connor who you’ve mentioned already today, former guest on the show gave us a whole bunch of suggestions.Astrid suggested Chomper for the Australovenator and Dave for Estaingia the trilobite. And also, direct to Alyssa Astrid gave you another suggestion,Alyssa Fjeld (1:00:14)And it was Tang and Tor. So it’s Estaingia taking the Tang from there, and Tor from the end of AustralovenatorTravis Holland (1:00:22)like that one. Jimmy Waldron, another past guest on the show from Dinosaurs Will Always Be Awesome, also an excellent dinosaur podcast and educator out there. Suggests Scratch for the Australovenator and Skitters for the trilobite.Alyssa Fjeld (1:00:36)Thank you. And then we also had a suggestion from, and I’m so sorry if I’m saying your name wrong, we’ve been mutuals forever on different social media. Sauriazoicillus suggested Scuttle and Claw, which is very my naming convention for my stuffed toys.Travis Holland (1:00:52)There’s just so many good names here. The Dino Nerd said Sizzle and Amy, which I love as well. Jack Perkins, who we’ve already mentioned. Do want to take this one?Alyssa Fjeld (1:00:57)Hehe suggested Meg and Tilly, which is adorable as well.Travis Holland (1:01:05)My wife is named Meg. So don’t know if I can go with that one. Just just Josh E or aka BlueMorpho86 on Instagram suggested Izzy and scrapsAlyssa Fjeld (1:01:10)Yeah, are you comparing her to the bug or the giant dinosaur? Tread carefully.Adelle Pentland also suggested Esteban and Megara, which so fancy, so Spanish, and then so very Hercules, the animated series. Love that. We also got a suggestion on Instagram that I can’t find anymore because it was a reply to the story and I don’t know what happened to it, I’m sorry, but Jack Jones also made a suggestion. Jack, if you’re listening, please message me your suggestion.Travis Holland (1:01:45)Natalia Jagielska, an excellent paleontologist from, I think currently working in the UK, suggests… Yeah, incredible. She does some incredible work. Natalia. Suggests Bobo and Bebe, which is a nice cute pair. I like that one.Alyssa Fjeld (1:01:52)Such a fangirl of her work, my gosh. I have her sticker on my laptop.Travis Holland (1:02:04)Also over on Blue Sky, someone going by name of Goose Buster suggested Dino and Craig. And I just love the notion of Craig.Alyssa Fjeld (1:02:12)is so like one of my supervisors is named Craig as well which is so funny.Travis Holland (1:02:16)We have to be careful that people don’t think we’re naming it after them. But also, we didn’t suggest these names. We didn’t come up with this list ourselves. Edge, who is a science YouTuber, suggested Todd and Ruffles as well, which is a really good one. And there was one more suggestion from BlueSky, which was Khamira who suggested Barry and Bob.Alyssa Fjeld (1:02:20)Yeah.No.Travis Holland (1:02:36)So just nice, simple Barry and Bob So how are we going to do this, Alyssa? How are we going to decide?Alyssa Fjeld (1:02:36)Bye.I’m struggling so much because I think they’re all so fantastic and I don’t think I can pick just one. I think I could pick three and that could be… I could pick that many.Travis Holland (1:02:51)Mm-hmm.Okay, so what if we pick three between us, three pairs, and we’ll put those up on Instagram for a final poll on the Fossils and Fiction Instagram account.Alyssa Fjeld (1:02:57)Yes.I think that’s such a good idea. And then it’s out of our hands yet again, and the fabulous people who made these suggestions can help us one last time.Travis Holland (1:03:13)So we’ll poll it on Instagram and we will also poll it on the show’s Spotify page. think that’s probably a good place. So if you want to engage with us on Spotify, you can do it there or on Instagram. We will poll the three suggested pairs. So we need to go with, okay, I’m going to pick out Dave and Craig. And I think Dave for the trial of bite.So this comes from one of Astrid’s suggestions and then Craig for the AustralovenatorAlyssa Fjeld (1:03:41)Thank you Goosebuster. And I think that’s so perfect. Like Dave, we had a colleague named Dave and I don’t want to say that he gives trilobite energy, but trilobites give Dave energy. Absolutely.Travis Holland (1:03:52)That’s one way to look at it.Alyssa Fjeld (1:03:54)promise this is not just a show of me negging my acquaintances. I love Scratch and Skitters. That’s so cute. it’s so cute. And then I don’t know, like my third pick would be Scuttle and Claw, but I have room in my heart for other suggestions if you really want to fight. Because like Tang and Tor also really, I like that as well. What do you think?Travis Holland (1:04:03)Scratch and Skitters from Jimmy Waldron yep.Tang and Tor is really good too. I think as a pair. So this is going to be Astrid. Astrid’s come up with the goods here. We know how creative Astrid is, but Astrid’s got three names in the six. So, all right, Tang and Tor from Astrid. We’re going to put these and that’s going to be good because then Astrid’s vote won’t swing it too much because who knows which one they’re to go for.Alyssa Fjeld (1:04:30)Yeah.Yeah, just think, yeah, those are such good choices and I’m so appreciative to everyone who wrote in. Thank you all so much.Travis Holland (1:04:49)Okay, Scratch and Skitters, Craig and Dave and Tang and Tor will go up on our Instagram and Spotify pages for a poll. We will compile the votes before our next episode and make a decision. And I think who the people who suggested these winners will make sure we get some stickers featuring the Australovenator and the Trilobite Estaingia Out to you.We’ll make sure we get those in the mail. If your names are the suggested ones, the suggested winners. So I so look forward to naming these cute little crittersAlyssa Fjeld (1:05:22)Yes, absolutely that and merch, the two best things in the world. And I might even, so my problem is buying a lot of stuffed animals and I might even use some of the ones we didn’t use for the show to name these other fabulous creatures behind me.Travis Holland (1:05:34)Yeah. I think we’re going to need somebody at some point to make them into stuffed animals.Fossils And Fiction (1:05:39)Travis dropping in post recording with an announcement to say that the next segment gets a little graphic. We talk about fighting prehistoric creatures and the various things they could do to a human. If you have sensitive ears listening into this episode, it might be best to skip ahead.Travis Holland (1:05:59)I’ve been listening to, PBS’s eons and in particular their new podcast series, which asks How would you survive?in a past prehistoric era. And so they have a different episode focusing on various eras So the Carboniferous is one I was listening to this morning and there’s the Devonian and the Cambrian explosion. So all of these different eras. I suddenly thought what it sounds like to me when they’re doing the interviews. So they have the main host, Callie, and then they take somebody else from the PBS Eons team.and they discuss how to survive the particular era. It’s a really, really cool podcast. Definitely worth checking out. But it sounded to me, I just keep picturing it as like, you know, like in a reality TV show, like Big Brother or something, they speak to the guests before they go into the house. And it’s like, what your strategy gonna be? How are you gonna win this thing? How are you gonna survive? And it sounds to me like the…these chats that they have on the podcast is like that. Like how are you going to go in and survive? And then it’s missing the next step, right? Even though it’s so well researched and so interesting is like, I would love to see a paleo doc done like this, where these interviews on PBS Eons are like the introduction tobefore they release somebody into the carboniferous.Alyssa Fjeld (1:07:21)It sounds like, so Ben Francischelli is a megalodon researcher here in Victoria. And he recently had an exhibit about priest work Bayside, which was a period of time when the Bomoras formation had megalodons and giant whales and all these like things that were out there that could totally kill you. And he filmed this short movie of himself fending off like Megs and things like it sounds.Travis Holland (1:07:25)YouAlyssa Fjeld (1:07:45)I promise you it’s super cool and I would watch a full-length version of that any day. was like absolutely- and we all think- like I can’t say we all think about it, but we think about it. Palaeontologists think about it.Travis Holland (1:07:58)would you actually survive in this era? So for our version of this, the Fossils and Fiction version of PBS’s Eon Surviving Deep Time is going to be which prehistoric animal would you fight? We’ve got three categories. The first one, the one that I’m going to put to you is prehistoric mammals. So you have four potential contenders. You have to choose which of these you would have the best opportunity of fighting against. MegatheriumAlyssa Fjeld (1:08:00)Yeah.Okay.Travis Holland (1:08:25)which is a giant Grand Sloth from South America. It is an elephant-sized animal with massive claws, incredibly strong. It’s like imagine wrestling a living, breathing tree with murder mittens. So it’s not, you know, this is not the sort of slow-moving sloth that we think of. This is a dangerous beast.Alyssa Fjeld (1:08:44)Yeah.Dense bones. If you see these guys at any of your local museums, you will notice that their bones are DENSE. And those murder mittens, he’s not kidding, the claws are ginormous.Travis Holland (1:09:01)that’s number one, the Megatherium. Number two is a Smilodon, your classic saber-toothed cat. This is like the size of a large lion with those massive canine teeth. It’s an ambush predator.Alyssa Fjeld (1:09:15)One of the strongest bite forces in the animal kingdom is my understanding.Travis Holland (1:09:15)IfYeah. So teeth the size of steak knives is the thing that you’re contending with mostly here. Now, this might seem like a gimme, but I don’t think it’s as easy as you would think. And the next one I’ve come up with is diprotodon, the largest marsupial ever. We’ve had an episode or a couple of episodes where diprotodon has been mentioned. This is a car-sized wombat.Alyssa Fjeld (1:09:36)Classic.Travis Holland (1:09:44)probably weighs two tons, massive body weight with thick hide and thick fur. not to mention pretty gnarly front teeth. I think even though this is a herbivore, it could take a decent bite out of you in a fight. If you think you can take down a living tank, this is the one to pick. And finally, a dire wolf.This is a larger than a modern wolf. I had the pleasure of going to the La Brea Tar Pits where they have a huge collection of dire wolf skulls earlier this year and to see them just laid out there, these are huge wolves. They pack hunt, they have extremely powerful bite.Okay, what do you think out of those four? Megatherium, Smilodon, Diprotodon, or Direwolf?Alyssa Fjeld (1:10:29)it’s so tough. It’s so tough because, you know, like it depends on what your attack strategy is, I think, right? Like, are you whittling down the boss’s health bar Elden Ring style, or are you waiting to interrupt the attack pattern of the world’s most dangerous kitty? I saw the beautifully preserved, really intact Smilodon skeleton at the Smithsonian on my visit and my gosh, likeI think the thing that impressed me more than its ability to completely nosh my brain would be how small it was compared to how absolutely murderous this thing would have been. But I know in my heart of hearts, I couldn’t find a kitty. I could never find a kitty cat. I would just, I would give up. I would let it eat my face. I can’t, yeah.Travis Holland (1:11:10)Okay, so we’re gonna rule out the Smilodon.Alyssa Fjeld (1:11:14)And then I’ve been to a wolf sanctuary before. It’s just thinking like the thing that I think all of us are thinking, which like, coyotes aren’t that big. Wolves can’t be, they, they are that big. are, that thing would destroy my face. So out of the remaining two, I would have to say.Travis Holland (1:11:30)So we’ve got the ground sloth, the megatherium or diprotodon, sometimes called a giant wombat.Alyssa Fjeld (1:11:35)Hmm.Travis Holland (1:11:37)What would you go with? Now, one of the other reasons I had to put Diprotodon in here is I came across this extraordinary fact around the way they use their, this is actual wombats now, not Diprotodon as far as we know, the way they use their girthy rear to block the entrance to their burrows and potentially squashany predators who try and come into the burrow against the roof of the burrow using their rear end.Alyssa Fjeld (1:12:08)Death by butt. Horrible. And like, no, this is true. This is all very true. There’s actually warning signs in areas with wombats to look out for them in your car because they will face your car with their butt like they would a predator. And your car is probably not gonna do great after that encounter. It will total your vehicle. It’s madness. I think out of those two, at least the diprotodon’s neck is not gonna have the same reach.that the megatherium’s claws are gonna have. Like that swing radius, if you could get behind it on the neck. And I’m prefacing this by saying I would die no matter what. look at these arms, these are not like slaying mitts. I’m a delicate creature. But if I had to, would pick the diprotodon I’m sorry, Australia. This is why I you citizens.Travis Holland (1:12:42)Youwell. So, Liz is gonna fight a protodon. If there’s anyone out there who would love to do some fan art of that, I’d love to see it.Alyssa Fjeld (1:13:02)Yeah, absolutely. No, I would pin it on my fridge. But I think it is now your turn to weigh in on a fight. Are you ready?Travis Holland (1:13:12)Yeah, go for it. Enjoy it. Yeah, go for it.Alyssa Fjeld (1:13:14)Okay, in this imaginary boxing ring, in one corner you have everyone’s favorite, the Velociraptor. A turkey-sized, much smaller than you would think based on the Jurassic Park movie, sharp, sickle-clawed, pack-hunting, intelligent murder chicken whose potential tagline, if he was on a poster, would be, technically smaller than you, but way more motivated.Travis Holland (1:13:41)I still think even though Velociraptor is smaller than the one in Jurassic Park, I still think of that Alan Grant line about using the claws to to gut you and then you are alive when they start eating you. And I just think that is so horrifying.Alyssa Fjeld (1:13:54)Yeah, and I mean, you know, turkey size… I like turkey size sounds reasonable at first, but like I challenge you to look up an American male turkey and ask whether you would even fight that creature.Travis Holland (1:14:07)mean, if you’ve ever had a goose chase you while you’re at a park or something, which I have, that would not be fun.Alyssa Fjeld (1:14:12)Mm-hmm.In the other corner, taking up a significantly larger foot square space, you have everyone’s king of lizards, Tyrannosaurus rex, a bus-sized predator who has a massive bone-crunching bite and incredible sensory skills. The movie had it all wrong. If you hold still, he’s absolutely still gonna biteTravis Holland (1:14:37)I think we can rule out T. rex straight away. mean, ain’t nobody, nobody taking on a T. rex. Unless, the only real chance here, but it’s not exactly a fight, is just to run and maybe, maybe you could outrun it.Alyssa Fjeld (1:14:47)Yeah.Yeah, outrun it or hope you pass by something that’s more delectable on the way out. You don’t have to be fast.Travis Holland (1:14:53)Yes, that’s another option. Or find a human-sized cave to hide in. Which the Jurassic Park book and movie also tried, right? In The Lost World, they hide in behind the waterfall. And was in the book in Jurassic Park, they hide in behind the waterfall, and the T. rex still gets them, so.Alyssa Fjeld (1:14:59)That’s… yes, yes.So much for hiding in our pleasant little mammal burrows. Okay, next up is one of my favorites. The Ankylosaur is a tank-sized dinosaur with a teeny tiny little brain and a massive thwacker, a clubbed tail, and an armored body. These animals were like living medieval weapons with built-in tank arms.Travis Holland (1:15:33)I feel like you get hit by this tail club and you just get pulverized. just, your body evaporates.Alyssa Fjeld (1:15:39)I think somebody put it best in our live chat saying that I think it hits with like the force of a hundred razor scooters. No, no more shin, something like that.Travis Holland (1:15:48)Yeah, that’s frighteningAlyssa Fjeld (1:15:52)And then last but certainly not least, we have everyone’s favorite contentious large dinosaur, our friend the Spinosaurus. Surprisingly larger than T. rex with a massive structure on its back, sail-like structure we think at present. I’m so hesitant to say anything about their anatomy. Spinosaurus fans do not at me. With semi-aquatic hunting skills. So we think this animal actually spent some of its life in water, which makes it scarier to go swimming.It’s part dinosaur, it’s part crocodile, and 100 % nightmare fuel.Travis Holland (1:16:22)Yeah. wow. I feel like these are worse options than you had.Alyssa Fjeld (1:16:27)Absolutely!Travis Holland (1:16:28)I T. rex is out. There’s no way I see a human escaping or successfully fighting a Tyrannosaurus rex. You just cannot. They were specialized for eating stuff.Alyssa Fjeld (1:16:29)Hmm.Yeah, stuff much more dangerous than us.Travis Holland (1:16:45)Yeah. Spinosaurus the same, whether in or out of the water, I do not fancy, fancy my chances against the Spinosaurus. I think, yeah, you know, I just can’t see that. I just can’t see that happening. You know, assuming we’re talking about like a, face to face, body to body fight here. Cause it’s like,Alyssa Fjeld (1:16:48)Hmm.at dawn.Travis Holland (1:17:09)Yeah, like if I could push a giant boulder onto the Spinosaurus while it swimming in the river, then, you know, okay. But if we’re not doing that, yeah, if that’s not what’s happening, then I think Spinosaurus is out too. which leaves me with Velociraptor and Ankylosaurus. Now I’m tempted just for the size factor to say Velociraptor.Alyssa Fjeld (1:17:16)Land Before Time method, yes.done.Travis Holland (1:17:29)But, you know, I mean, that thing is gonna just rip me apart. Like, there’s a lot of meat on me and I think a velociraptor would see that as quite a snackable thing. So I think I’m just, you know, it’s gonna rip my ankles open and I’m not gonna be able to move and that’s the end. So I’m gonna have to go with ankylosaurus. Now here’s how this will work.Alyssa Fjeld (1:17:34)Mmm.Travis Holland (1:17:55)I see myself fashioning a stick into a sharp point. And although ankylosaurus had incredible armor and osteoderms all over its body, I reckon I can get that point into a gap somewhere.Alyssa Fjeld (1:18:11)slaying a very bloated and slow-moving land-bound Tolkien-esque dragon.Travis Holland (1:18:16)Yeah, I feel like the only thing about an Ankylosaurus that’s fast is probably the swing of the tail club. So all I gotta do is avoid that. If I get hit by that tail club, as I say, I think it’s just like red mist evaporating. Sorry, this is really gross. We’re have to put language warning on this episode.Alyssa Fjeld (1:18:29)Yeah, instant fatality.And again, if anybody wants to make fan art of Travis dragon style murdering this ankylosaur, I can only encourage that behavior.Travis Holland (1:18:45)Yeah, I think that’s that’s fair. Yeah, so I don’t know if we’re at the sort of fans the sort of size where we have fans who make some fan art of us. But if one wants to make someone wants to make fan art of me, file it fighting an ankylosaurus or Alyssa fighting a diprotodon, then I’d love to actually we’ve kind of got the same. We’ve kind of got the same choice there actually, haven’t we? Yeah.Alyssa Fjeld (1:19:06)We both picked tanks, which I think says something about our usual video game style approach.Travis Holland (1:19:12)Okay, the last one we’re gonna we’re gonna work through this one together. This is your assorted otherswe have first up Megalodon, which is the whale sized shark. Absolutely huge, often compared to, think, mostly inaccurately, except perhaps in the terms of niche partitioning to a great white shark. enormous skills and assuming here that you’re in the ocean, because what’s that old joke about a shark can swim faster than me, but I can outrun a shark. So in a triathlon, I’d come down to the cycling event.Alyssa Fjeld (1:19:19)features.Travis Holland (1:19:42)We’re not talking about that. But assume you’re in the water here with a megalodon.Alyssa Fjeld (1:19:46)Yeah, if you’re in the water, this thing’s got…Yeah, so after that we have, this is one of my favorites, Sarcosuchus. A super croc. He was longer than a city bus with massive jaws and an armored body. I wanna say this one is an Aussie native, is that right?Travis Holland (1:19:54)Circus, circus, yeah.I don’t think Sarcosuchus was, but there’s plenty of other crocodiles of large size from Australia.Alyssa Fjeld (1:20:13)I just wanted to say crikey, but that’s okay. This isn’t just a… I think all I would manage to say is, and then I would just be dead. Yeah, modern crocodiles, excellent animals have not had to evolve because they’re already nature’s perfect murder log. And this is just a larger murder log, a murder redwood, if you will.Travis Holland (1:20:17)You can say that when it’s coming at you, like no worries.Yeah. And so here again, I think you get a choice between, you know, you’re in the riverbank area. You may not be in the water, but you’re in the area that we assume.Alyssa Fjeld (1:20:43)like an ambush predator style thing, right? Again, Burt people, I’m sorry. Yeah.Travis Holland (1:20:48)Yeah, he’s, he’s, Sarcosuchus is definitely going to be, going to be difficult to fight. So, okay. Mosasaurus, massive marine reptile, very powerful swimmer, huge crushing bite. this is like a great white shark mixed with a sea dragon.Alyssa Fjeld (1:21:05)These things are just terrifyingly large. You might think from the Jurassic World franchise, you have an idea of how really terrifying it would be to be around them. But I think standing next to the models in museums gives you a much frighteninger experience of this animal. They are huge, huge, with great big teeth.Travis Holland (1:21:24)you would not want to be in the water with a mosasaur, but that’s what we’re asking.Alyssa Fjeld (1:21:30)But if, and if you were on land, you would also still not be safe depending on the time period you’re in. Our good friend, Quetzalcoatlus. The Quetzalcoatlus is named for one of the Mayan winged serpent gods. And the brutality of the god is definitely reflected in this animal. It was a giraffe-sized flying reptile with a massive wingspan and a sharp beak. And again,Birds might not at first feel frightening, but I think pelicans are freaky deaky and this animal could just absolutely have snapped you up in its beak and that would have been the end of you.Travis Holland (1:22:03)it makes me think of those pelicans when you see them. Like, just recently I saw a pelican eating a dove, I think, or a seagull. So it just had a full, and there’s also these videos going around of pelicans trying to pick up capybaras.Alyssa Fjeld (1:22:16)Yes, yes, that that great meme of like, put the baby in the pelican’s mouth.Travis Holland (1:22:20)Yeah. So we’re going to say the pterosaur that could scoop you up like a snack. I have a true weight advantage compared to you on that one, I think, which is great.Alyssa Fjeld (1:22:25)Yes.To be honest, I’m thinking he would be the choice either way because out of all of these, he would have the lightest bones, which would make him easier to throw a big rock at, I think.Travis Holland (1:22:43)Okay, so we’re gonna go and fight the Quetzalcoatlus.Alyssa Fjeld (1:22:46)think that’s my go, because Ben Francischelli has made me too afraid of the Megalodon.Travis Holland (1:22:50)I have enough problems with deep, deep water without thinking about an actual Megalodon or Mosasaurus for that matter. Yeah, I think you’re totally right. Unless Sarchosuchus is subject to this, what’s the apocryphal story about running diagonally to try and get away from a crocodile, then, but again,Alyssa Fjeld (1:22:54)HmmYeah.yeah, serpentining, yeah.Travis Holland (1:23:13)you know, if you’ve actually got a face up to it, then Quetzalcoatlus is probably the one, probably the one to go with. I think it’s going to result with, you know, speared through the belly by the beak, but there we go. It’s probably the best option.Alyssa Fjeld (1:23:25)yeah or just now you’re airborne now you’re not and then you’re a delicious see this is what I like about the Cambrian most of the things during this period probably couldn’t have killed me and some of them look delicious I think more about eating them than being murdered by themTravis Holland (1:23:30)Yeah.I absolutely came really close to like putting putting a trilobite here or anomalocaris or those kinds of early weirdosAlyssa Fjeld (1:23:50)To be honest, it would probably be either the giant Eryphryd’s, which I did a thread about on Blue Sky recently, which could get up to, we think, eight feet in length, or it would be the giant Lobopods. Gilled Lobopods Omnidens would have been about five feet in the Cambrian with one of those radial mouths. He keeps me up at night, but most other things during that time period, the size comparison would be like, hats, house cats.Travis Holland (1:24:13)Yeah, Trilobites I feel like would be pretty easy. You just need a reasonably sharp rock and…Alyssa Fjeld (1:24:19)or very big shoe. They are a stompable animal, I think. Maybe crab. Anyway.Travis Holland (1:24:23)Youwell that’s very interesting. So we are going to go out there and you are going to fight a diprotodon I am going to fight an ankylosaurus and then together we’re going to go after a quetzacoatlusAlyssa Fjeld (1:24:39)Delicious giant turkey of the sky.Travis Holland (1:24:42)Turkey of the sky. Now I want some fan art of a quetzocoatlus done up like a turkey ready to go into the baster, into the roaster. I think that’s a good point to end this, almost to end this episode on, that we should go away and come up with your favourite Christmas recipes featuring extinct animals.Alyssa Fjeld (1:24:49)Mmm. Send us your recipes.Absolutely, yes. See how you can incorporate those delicious little hadrosaurs in your next family meal.Travis Holland (1:25:11)Yeah, we’ll come back in January and maybe come up with some suggestions. I just want to note that our friends at the Common Descent podcast have been named as one of the top natural science podcasts by Podbean.Overall, they’re just fantastic. So I really hope people get out and listen to them if you haven’t. I’m sure anyone who listens to this podcast also listens to Common Descent, but they are fantastic guys. So if you’ve not hung out with David and Will, fully recommend it as well.Alyssa Fjeld (1:25:37)And they’ve just done an episode with Adele. So if you’re a fan of her interview on this podcast, check her out there.Travis Holland (1:25:42)Yeah, Adele’s been on this podcast a couple of times. She’s so great. She’s a lot of fun. I’m sure. Have you ever actually hung out with Adele?Alyssa Fjeld (1:25:50)have and I can guarantee you that she is absolutely as fabulous and fun in person as she is on camera. It’s absolutely a delight to have a chat with her and to just hang out. She’s so fascinating. I can pick her brain all day. She knows so much stuff, not just about dinosaurs, but farming and all sorts of things.Travis Holland (1:26:05)Awesome.Yeah, she’s certainly a lot of fun. So shout out to Adele, shout out to Common Descent, to Astrid and Edge and Natalia and everyone else who gave us suggestions for names. We’re going to make sure those are up on the polls. Thank you so much for listening in so far to this rebooted Fossils and Fiction andAlyssa Fjeld (1:26:17)Colin and Jack for…Travis Holland (1:26:31)We’re to have episodes fortnightly throughout 2025, so make sure you tune in then.Alyssa Fjeld (1:26:35)have a great holiday season and a happy new year.

    "text": "@katekate There's a long weekend, second Monday in June, like good colonials we celebrate the monarch's birthday!The Immigration museum is excellent. You'll probably walk down the Yarra, and it's just on the north bank, not far from the aquarium. I find the botanic gardens a bit uninspiring, but they're still a nice walk not far from the city. Going further out, Phillip Island is great to sea Penguins and world class surf beaches like Woolamai. Meanwhile, Healesville is great, with an amazing wildlife sanctuary, and an excellent Beechworth Bakery next to a micro brewery. Healesville is in the Yarra Valley where there are lots of vineyards, if you're into that. The Ocean Road is a must and probably won't be so busy in June. Try to go to Tower Hill, past Warrnambool. It is a natural wildlife sanctuary with kangaroos, emu, wombats etc. The Otways are on the Ocean Rd between Lorne and Apollo Bay. You'll find huge mountain ash trees there. Other great places: Belgrave and Mt Dandenong, Echuca on the Murray River  in the north of the state, Bright near the Alps, The Grampians to the West, and Ballarat with its gold mining history. My personal favourite is east of Melbourne, the underrated Gippsland where I used to live. 90 mile  beach, mangroves at Venus Bay, the breathtaking Wilson's Prom, and historic sub alpine towns like Noojee and Walhalla. Sorry, not sure how long you have, how mobile you'll be, your interests etc.Enjoy 🙂",

    "text": "How Creationism and Intelligent Design Undermine Canadian Science Education: The Trinity Western University CaseAuthor(s): Scott Douglas JacobsenPublication (Outlet/Website): Personal SubStackPublication Date (yyyy/mm/dd): 2025/04/01Creationism and Intelligent Design are primarily an Abrahamic-religion-created problem. They come, most often, out of white Evangelical Christianity, Protestant Christianity, followed by other Christian denominations and then in the form of some Islamic creationists and Intelligent Design advocates. There has been, recently, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), as one Intelligent Design promoting society based on the religious beliefs of the Hare Krishnas. Several organizations exist devoted to the movement for the pseudoscientific and genericized theological position: The Center for Science and Culture (formerly Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture) of the Discovery Institute, Access Research Network, the Foundation for Thought and Ethics, the Intelligent Design and Evolution Awareness Center, and the Intelligent Design Network, while others specifically devote themselves to Creationism such as the Institute for Creation Research, Answers in Genesis, Creation Ministries International, and Creation Science Evangelism. Even societies emerged, for example, the International Society for Complexity, Information, and Design (ISCID) contains numerous individuals deeply involved, even as fellows, including Michael Behe, John Angus Campbell, Robin Collins, Bruce L. Gordon, Muzaffar Iqbal, William Lane Craig, William A. Dembski, Scott Minnich, Alvin Plantinga, Jonathan Wells, Jeffrey M. Schwartz, and lesser-known others. On home turf, in Canadian society, we come to the issues of Creationism and Intelligent Design, too, with a center of the storm in Langley, British Columbia, Canada, through Trinity Western University. All these can be drivers of public ignorance on the subject matter of evolution via natural selection.Examination of the American context is informative for the Canadian environs. According to Marshall Berman in “Intelligent Design: The New Creationism Threatens All of Science and Society“ in APS News (APS Physics), circa 2001 via Gallup polls, 45% of Americans believe the following statement: “God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so.” It’s about half as many Canadians compared now. Only about 1/5 hold similar views. As noted in “Freethought for the Small Towns: A Case Study“[1], the heart of Evangelical Christianity in Canadian society, probably, comes in the form of the private Evangelical Christian university Trinity Western University and the surrounding communities with one found in Fort Langley, a lovely community village and a National Historic Site, which happens to exists on the periphery of Trinity Western University’s fundamentalist Evangelical community, higher education, and doctrinal mandates for community seen in their “Community Covenant“ and “Statement of Faith.” The “Community Covenant” stipulates:The University’s mission, core values, curriculum and community life are formed by a firm commitment to the person and work of Jesus Christ as declared in the Bible… The University is an interrelated academic community rooted in the evangelical Protestant tradition; it is made up of Christian administrators (including the members of the Board of Governors), faculty and staff who covenant together to form a community that strives to live according to biblical precepts, believing that this will optimize the University’s capacity to fulfil its mission and achieve its aspirations. The community covenant is a solemn pledge in which members place themselves under obligations… By doing so, members accept reciprocal benefits and mutual responsibilities… It is vital that each person who accepts the invitation to become a member of the TWU community carefully considers and sincerely embraces this community covenant… The University’s acceptance of the Bible as the divinely inspired, authoritative guide for personal and community life1 is foundational to its affirmation that people flourish and most fully reach their potential when they delight in seeking God’s purposes, and when they renounce and resist the things that stand in the way of those purposes being fulfilled… TWU reserves the right to question, challenge or discipline any member in response to actions that impact personal or social welfare… sexual intimacy is reserved for marriage between one man and one woman, and within that marriage bond it is God’s intention that it be enjoyed as a means for marital intimacy and procreation… This formal covenant applies to those that serve the TWU community, that is, administrators, faculty and staff employed by TWU and its affiliates. Unless specifically stated otherwise, expectations of this covenant apply to both on and off TWU’s campus and extension sites. Sincerely embracing every part of this covenant is a requirement for employment. Employees who sign this covenant also commit themselves to abide by campus policies published in their respective Faculty and Staff Handbooks. TWU welcomes all students who qualify for admission, recognizing that not all affirm the theological views that are vital to the University’s Christian identity. While students are not required to sign this covenant, they have chosen to be educated within a Christian university that unites reason and faith. [Emphasis added.]Within this community framework built or constructed by the “Community Covenant,” by fear of inability to become employed at Trinity Western University, as in “embracing every part of this covenant is requirement for employment,” all facets of this theological and social covenant must be agreed to – without qualms. As was expressed to me, “If I don’t sign the covenant, I don’t get a [work] contract.” As I have heard, one individual who worked at Trinity Western University and got divorced while employed, but who, as an employee, signed the contract. Thus, she was given a time limit to leave the position because of breaking community standards for something in personal life, i.e., getting divorced. This is an anecdote, not a charge, but this does raise alarms about internal culture. Be mindful, students had to sign this in previous times, as early as 2018.However, the mandatory status for students was removed once Trinity Western University lost the Supreme Court of Canada case for its proposed law school 7-2. It was seen as an overwhelming loss and embarrassment to the community, as much legitimacy and respectability hinged on its success as an institution representative of Evangelical Christian postsecondary liberal arts education in the nation. In addition to the “Community Covenant,” the “Statement of Faith” makes similar statements about the explicit faith-based nature of the enterprise:God’s gospel originates in and expresses the wondrous perfections of the eternal, triune God… God’s gospel is authoritatively revealed in the Scriptures… God’s gospel alone addresses our deepest need… God’s gospel is made known supremely in the Person of Jesus Christ… God’s gospel is accomplished through the work of Christ… God’s gospel is applied by the power of the Holy Spirit… God’s gospel is now embodied in the new community called the church… God’s gospel compels us to Christ-like living and witness to the world… God’s gospel will be brought to fulfillment by the Lord Himself at the end of this age… God’s gospel requires a response that has eternal consequences.Overall, the nature of the covenant and the statement make the coercive nature of the private religious, Evangelical, in particular, institution much clearer. The Canadian Association of University Teachers found much the same years ago. (We will explore this in future articles.)Its surrounding environs in Langley, including Fort Langley may be undergoing a retitling – attempted – by some work of the Township of Langley Council[2] through naming of a larger “University District,” as part of an expansionist vision for the Evangelical post-secondary institution. Noting, of course, it’s a private religious university, not public. In this sense, private religious forces using public cachet and political efforts to drop an illegitimate curtain of religious and ideological association on the entire area if this happens. It’s unfair, unjust, and shouldn’t happen at all, in my opinion. The most comprehensive statement on creationism within Canadian society exists in “Canadians’ and Others’ Convictions to Divine Interventionism in the Matters of the Origins and Evolution“[3].Now, to be clear, on Creationism and Intelligent Design as such, RationalWiki lists several scientific organizations, as a contrast to the creationist and intelligent design advocate organizations mentioned above, making explicit rejection of the claims of Creationism and Intelligent Design, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Association of University Professors, American Astronomical Society, American Chemical Society, American Geophysical Union, American Institute of Physics, American Psychological Association, American Society of Agronomy, American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Botanical Society of America, Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, National Association of Biology Teachers, National Center for Science Education, National Science Teachers Association, United States National Academy of Sciences, Kentucky Academy of Science, Kentucky Paleontological Society, Lehigh University Department of Biological Sciences, Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity Nobel Laureates Initiative, Council of Europe, Intelligent Design is not Science Initiative, Interacademy Panel Statement on the Teaching of Evolution, International Society for Science and Religion, Project Steve, Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, and the Royal Society. There’s no question. Intelligent Design and Creationism are pseudoscientific views, theological proposals, not scientific theories or even simple hypotheses. To quote one of the core intellectual founders of Intelligent Design – and a nice and intelligent man, Dr. William Dembski, “I believe God created the world for a purpose. The Designer of intelligent design is, ultimately, the Christian God.” [Emphasis added.] Thusly, for any higher education institution to so much as entertain that which is duly rejected as comical to the vast majority of practicing biologists and biology teachers is a disgrace to the value of “higher” in “higher education,” as I will present, these views have been encouraged unduly at Trinity Western University, and the community value statement and covenant prevent open speaking out against particular areas of academic silliness and prejudice because everyone is bound together in a coercive setup. No question about it.So, Langley comes inter-related with some of the other communities, including some of the fundamentalist communities in Abbotsford. Those fundamentalist communities of Abbotsford link to the creationist communities in the area. As Andres Michael McKinnon in “Civil Society, public spheres and the ecology of environmentalism in four Fraser Valley communities: Burnaby, Richmond, Langley and Abbotsford” (1997) stated, “Local issues have been even more shaped by conservative religion: the Abbotsford school board tried to mandate ‘Creationism’ being taught in public school classrooms; a Lower Mainland gay weekly, X-tra West was banned from Abbotsford Public Libraries in 1994; activism on “conservative” moral issues such as abortion, euthanasia and violence on television is significant; prayer in public schools continued in most District 34 public elementary school classrooms until very recently, despite a Supreme Court Injunction; and a play by a local high-school student which openly discussed sexuality was banned by the school board. If Abbotsford is a very religious community, it is also, as Elliott and Simpson suggest, “a town divided into a series of relatively insulated communities organised around religion and ethnicity.” Conservative religious communities in one region connect to another.It should be noted. The history comes with individuals running for schools boards. For example, when Dr. Darrell Furgason (Ph.D., Religious Studies) ran for the Chilliwack, British Columbia, school board, he is known as a lecturer at Trinity Western University, involved in education for more than 35 years, and who expresses open belief in “Biblical creationism, often referred to as Young Earth creationism” to quote Paul Henderson in “Biblical creationist joins Chilliwack school board race“ (The Chilliwack Progress). In a post on Creation.Com, he stated, “Theistic evolution is a wrong view of Genesis, as well as history, and biology. Adam & Eve were real people….who lived in real history….around 6000 [sic] years ago.” A lot of the creationist controversies start in this Bible Belt as a center of Canadian versions of Creationism.As stated by Chris Woods in “Big Bang versus a Big Being,” “Certainly, this is far from the collision between Christian and secular morality in a region widely considered to be British Columbia’s Bible Belt… the area’s dozens of evangelical and fundamentalist churches, Bible colleges and flourishing private Christian schools reinforce its reputation for deep religious faith. That image has been bolstered by previous controversies.” Woods spoke of the attempts (circa 1995) to “ban a weekly gay and lesbian-oriented newspaper published in Vancouver from its shelves.” He continued, “Observed Cindy Filipenko, editor of the since-reinstated X-tra West: “I think the religious right has an agenda that is, basically, freedom for themselves and not for anybody else.” It’s a fascinating article.Further, he found 56% of people from Abbotsford (of the time) believed the Bible was the “literal record of God’s word” based on a CV Marketing Research of Abbotsford poll of 110 people taken in November of 1993. Vancouver MarketTrend Research discovered 55% of people in the Lower Mainland believed “government should do more to support basic Christian values.” These are theocratically minded sentiments with the idea of non-separation of government and religion, i.e., non-neutrality. At the time, John Sutherland was the dean of business management at Trinity Western University and the Chair of the Abbotsford school board. He gave Bible classes within the Mennonite religion. The Vice-Chairman of the School board was Paul Chamberlain, who was another evangelical-minded Trinity Western faculty member. One school trustee of the time, Gerda Fandrich – an Evangelical Christian, stated, “There is scientific evidence that will support creationist theory, and there is scientific evidence against the theory of evolution in its entirety. And it should be taught.” When is a school board obliged to vote out scientifically ignorant or incompetent people out of it? We’re talking about the educational health and scientific literacy of the region, as well as the preservation of freedom of religion via the separation of religion and government.It comes out in the national commentary or the comments on the national happenings of the country. The Governor General a couple years ago spoke out, calmly, and with a tinge of humor against pseudoscience. Dr. John Neufeld in “Governor General Julie Payette of Canada Mocks Creationism“ from Back to the Bible Canada stated, “Julie Payette is Canada’s new Governor General. At a recent speech to scientists at an Ottawa convention, Ms. Payette was very clear about how she felt about religion. She mocked those who were still debating about whether life came about as a result of divine intervention rather than natural processes.” That’s the opening statement and a common ignorant statement throughout Canada. At least, 1/5 Canadians hold creationist views. These are anti-scientific. When a credentialed and respectable woman critiques Creationism, not the religious individuals who adhere to it, educated and articulate people, as with Neufeld, conflate the critique of Creationism with critical and condescending attitudes about religious people; this presents the reality of the individuals’ views of (their) religion in Canada, i.e., as intrinsically adherent to creationist accounts rather than evolutionary plus theistic perspectives. It is, tacitly, to admit of the anti-scientific attitudes and stances of many theists in the country, including Neufeld. It is to take offense rather than provide a defense, or to take on the persistent garb among some educated classes of anti-intellectualism.As seems reasonably clear, especially for individuals who read the first footnote (below) in detail, the connection between the lack of critical thinking in the places of worship, as in faith-based lectern lectures or homilies on the nature of reality and morality, and then the influence on the capacity for critical thought in the wider community. This seems to happen in the advanced industrial societies in which religion, traditional as such, maintains its large hold on the majority of the mind of the population. We can draw this back to the post-colonial context of Canada. According to Pew Research in “5 facts about religion in Canada,” Canadians continue to maintain their religious fervor as a population. More than half, about 55%, of Canadians, based on the Spring 2018 Global Attitudes Survey as reported by Pew Research, identify as Christian, while 29% adhere to the category of “religiously unaffiliated,” 14% identify as “Other,” and 2% don’t know. More precisely, “A declining share of Canadians identify as Christians, while an increasing share say they have no religion – similar to trends in the United States and Western Europe,” “Our most recent survey in Canada, conducted in 2018, found that a slim majority of Canadian adults (55%) say they are Christian, including 29% who are Catholic and 18% who are Protestant. About three-in-ten Canadians say they are either atheist (8%), agnostic (5%) or “nothing in particular” (16%). Canadian census data indicate that the share of Canadians in this “religiously unaffiliated” category rose from 4% in 1971 to 24% in 2011, although it is lowest in Quebec.” With this decline in Christian religious affiliation in Canada, the number of Canadians who identify as Christian should collapse to below simple majority circa some time in 2020/2021.These demographic declines may produce some forms of belligerent politico-religious identity. In fact, given the evidence, they have done so in the past. Bruce Myers in “Beware the rise of the ‘theo-cons’“ reviewed The Rise of Christian Nationalism in Canada by Marci McDonald. He warned about aspects of Evangelical Christians and Christian Nationalism. He stated:For a long time disparate and unorganized, conservative-minded Christians in Canada found a single voice in the national debate over same-sex marriage. Their unified opposition galvanized them into a political force to be reckoned with, and one courted more and more by the federal Conservatives.Inspired by successful examples in the U.S., efforts by so-called Christian nationalists to influence Canadian public policy have increased since Stephen Harper’s Tories took office, McDonald argues. Notably, a growing number of socially conservative Christian organizations have in recent years established a permanent presence in Ottawa. They include such groups as Focus on the Family Canada, the National House of Prayer, and Trinity Western University’s Laurentian Leadership Centre.These efforts, McDonald says, are aimed at finding their fulfilment in what she calls the “Armageddon factor or the belief that Canada has some particularly significant role to play during the so-called ‘end times.’ “ For those who believe, fulfilling this destiny means transforming Canada into nothing less than a “Bible-based theocracy.”However, this isn’t a unified trend. In fact, we come to the idea of pluralization of religion in Canadian society with the inclusion of other faiths in the demographic placement of the hole previously filled in the national demographic pie by Christianity. Pew Research reports this is largely due to immigration. Muslims, Hindus, Jews, and Buddhists, comprise 8% of Canadian adults. If the trends continue, or if the adult demographics are indicative of the youth bulge, then the freethought community, and the Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Jewish, and Buddhist communities take a larger portion of the upcoming young generations. “Most Canadians” see religion in public life as a waning influence in the country with 64% stipulating that it plays a less important role in the country than in years prior. Canadians are ambivalent as to whether it is a positive or negative net influence on society. In spite of this emotive ambiguity, there are “low levels of government restrictions on religion.” Also, even with these proclaimed religious individuals, or perceived levels of engagement in religious self-identification, few Canadians truly take part, frequently, in the traditional religious practices including prayer daily or worship once per week. Canadians probably can’t be seen, by and large, as a religious people, though can be seen as a largely religious identifying people in the nation. That’s all Pew Research. This can raise some intriguing side questions about the nature, not of religion per se, but, more precisely, of the nature of religious identity based on these demographic trends and the formulations of religious identification.As the ongoing polarization of the communities of the United States continue apace, some of the similar trends continue in Canadian society with the collapse of Christianity as a significant majority piece of the religious and non-religious demographic pie. What’s the relevance to all of this to Creationism and Intelligent Design? Quite simply, it’s the association betwixt the two and the Evangelical religious universities; as a Canadian, and as a local, these become relevant subject matters. How is, dear reader, there encouragement of Creationism in higher education? Why should it stop? The latter is easier to answer than the former, “It’s wrong, not science, and catastrophically embarrassing on the grounds of any post-secondary institution, private or public, in Canadian society, to many Christians, other faithful people, and the freethought communities (specially so).” To the former, let’s sit down and chat a while, the answers exist, though. Would invitations for talks by creationists or teaching courses friendly to the content make the point? These shouldn’t happen at a respectable institution. In fact, most of the presentations and lectures by creationists happen at churches more than anywhere else based on a national analysis in previous research.Intelligent Design is rooted in religion. As R.N. Carmona in “The Evidence for Evolution: A Succinct Introduction for Denialists“ said, “The lack of success of these views is literally the tip of the iceberg. That they’re not successful isn’t what determines that they’re pseudoscience. Pick any of the demarcation theories put forth by philosophers of science and you’ll find that creationism and ID don’t meet the requirements to pass as science. Take, for example, Popper’s falsification. Can we falsify the intelligent designer who, according to many ID advocates, is the Judeo-Christian god? What matters here is not whether a naturalist or an atheist can falsify him. What matters is whether ID advocates are willing to attempt falsification of the intelligent designer. Since their view is rooted in religion, we can be reasonably certain that they’re not going to attempt to falsify the intelligent designer.”It impacts education. Frederika Oosterhoff expressed concern in “Teaching Evolution At Our Schools – Why and How“ about interpretations of Scripture and teaching evolution in Reformed Academic (Canadian Reformed Church). Oosterhoof said, “Evolution can be taught and evaluated in a straightforward manner as a well-established biological theory that has weaknesses as well as strengths. It can also be taught and then explained away – and I am afraid this is done at some of our schools – as lie and deception, the devil’s own work. Related to this second approach is enlisting the help of certain videos and other material provided by young-earth-creationism. As one principal told me, these ‘creation-science’ products are quite popular in our schools. Indeed, young-earth creationism is widely upheld as ‘Reformed doctrine.’ Often, the principal wrote, schools use the material to make evolution look “stupid,” something we can chuckle about…” It’s a sad state of affairs and a depressing commentary of the status of the churches and Christian religious communities in North America.On March 9 2019 from 7:00pm to 9:00pm, Trinity Western University hosted “EVOLUTIONARY AND YOUNG-EARTH CREATIONISM: TWO SEPARATE LECTURES.” It stated, “All are welcome to attend, Public Lecture, hosted by TWU’s ‘Science, Faith, and Human Flourishing: Conversations in Community Initiative,’ supported by Fuller Seminary, Faculty of Natural and Applied Sciences, and the Canadian Scientific & Christian Affiliation, “Evolutionary and Young-Earth Creationism: Two Separate Lectures” (Darrel Falk[4], “Evolution, Creation and the God Who is Love” and Todd Wood, “The Quest: Understanding God’s Creation in Science and Scripture”).” Todd C. Wood is the Founding President of the Core Academic of Science, and a young earth creationist. Darrel R. Falk is an Emeritus Professor of Biology at Point Loma Nazarene University, and an evolutionary creationist. Two creationists invited to ‘educate’ about their ‘theories,’ more theological argument than anything else. Several events with them including “Evolutionary Creation & Young-Earth Creationism.” It stated:If humans and all forms of life were created through the evolutionary process—and the evidence for this is very strong—it presents a potential dilemma for Christians. Why would the God who taught us to love the weak and feed the hungry, the God who told us that the meek shall inherit the earth seemingly create humankind through the seemingly heartless process sometimes referred to as “survival of the fittest?”These are interesting times in evolutionary biology. The discipline has itself been evolving and many of its leaders are recognizing the significance sometimes of cooperation as a dynamic and important component of the evolutionary process. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that a key driving component in the change that has taken place in our lineage—the hominin lineage—for at least three million years has been the importance of individuals being able to work together as a communal unit within small groups. Some scholars would even go so far as to say it is the “Secret of Our Success.” Perhaps—this talk will suggest—biological fitness in our lineage is not that different than the qualities that Jesus laid out as being central to the Christian life. We’ll explore the evidence for this. But more than that, we’ll also explore the question of the nature of divine action in the ongoing history of creation. As Christians we believe that God is an active, even personal presence in our lives through the Holy Spirit. Is there some form of consistency between the God we believe we experience in our individual lives, and the activity of the God who was present and active hundreds of thousand to millions of years ago? This is a key question for Christians to think about and this talk will explore possible answers.Another event entitled “Science and Faith: A Conversation in Community, With Darrel Falk & Todd Wood,” with the last event entitled “The Fool, the Heretic, and the God Whose Standard is Love.” It, the last one, stated:Discussions of the science and theology of creation has been the source of strenuous conflicts among Christians. Darrel Falk and Todd Wood are Christians who hold different positions on creation, and hold them strongly. However, with a shared bond in Christ, through a series of conversations facilitated by The Colossian Forum, they have developed an ability to communicate well, care for one another, and pursue truth and love in edifying ways.More on Their Co-Authored Book:In a brief, memoir-like narrative, The Fool and the Heretic tracks the improbable relationship between two scientists who not only hold opposing views on their deeply held views of origins, but believe each is doing serious damage to the church. The book is a deeply personal story told by two respected scientists who hold opposing views on the topic of origins, share a common faith in Jesus Christ, and began a sometimes-painful journey to explore how they can remain in Christian fellowship when each thinks the other is harming the church. To some in the church, anyone who accepts the theory of evolution has rejected biblical teaching and is therefore thought of as a heretic. To many outside the church as well as a growing number of evangelicals, anyone who accepts the view that God created the earth in six days a few thousand years ago must be poorly educated and ignorant–a fool. Todd Wood and Darrel Falk know what it’s like to be thought of, respectively, as a fool and a heretic. This book shares their pain in wearing those labels, but more important, provides a model for how faithful Christians can hold opposing views on deeply divisive issues yet grow deeper in their relationship to each other and to God. (source)Wood provided some post-event commentary in “Further thoughts from Trinity Western University.” If this isn’t too much, even more, they have a stipulated course, SCS 691 – Creationism Field Trip, i.e., an upper-level course devoted, specifically, to Creationism. Trinity Western University has another course entitled “SCS 503 – Creationism & Christainity [sic] (Korean)” Both are 3-credit courses. There are exceptions, though, outstanding people.One of my favourite people, Professor Dennis Venema, works at the institution and gives talks entitled “Why I Accept Evolution (and Why You Probably Should As Well).” Stuff like this is great, and should be commended. It’s a difficult balance. To some respectable degree, he pulls it off. The abstract states:Evolution is both a well-attested scientific theory and an area of science commonly disputed by Christians. Is it “compromise” or “capitulation” for a believer to accept the findings of evolutionary biology? Should Christians fight against evolutionary theory using “creationism” or “Intelligent Design”? Do the arguments of ID proponents such as Michael Behe, Stephen Meyer, and William Lane Craig stand up to scrutiny? Is an evolutionary understanding of creation in conflict with scripture? This talk will address these questions and argue that Christians are better served by adopting evolutionary creationism as a model for human origins.Venema does a tremendous service in the community because of the presentation of the reality of evolution via natural selection in an environment in which Creationism – young and old – and Intelligent Design have become seen as differing base perspectives on the fundamental nature of biological reality. Each directing attention to the divine hand of God in some form or another. In Christian Week, Venema stated, “Evolution is so well supported, and the evidence for it so compelling, that one cannot reject evolution and claim to have an up-to-date view of science.” Now, You can get obtuse comparisons, as with Michael Gohen in “Science and Scripture: What do we do with conflict?”, who made the explicit claim of the equivalency of validity of the evidence for God in the Bible and in the geological sciences. He concluded in the presentation, “Evolutionary theory is damaging to church’s life especially as it assumes the status of full-blown worldview… Absorption of Scripture into scientific worldview (Scripture must remain final authority!)…”Unfortunately, as with many Christian perspectives on these matters, they’re simply wrongsolely for the fact of infusion of theology as the explanatory gap in which the ‘gap’ does not amount to a gap at all. Evolution via natural selection filled several mechanism gaps previously handed to God on High as the explanatory filter. Yet, as an Evangelical institution, as part of the same event with Professor Venema, there was the inclusion of a response by Dr. Paul Brown “from an Intelligent Design perspective“ to the presentation by Professor Venema. Here’s the problem, to present an Intelligent Design view gives the illusion of a ‘debate’ in which no debate exists, there’s only one game in the scientific town: evolution via natural selection. It’s a disservice to community and a misrepresentation of the state of the science. Venema is intelligent, conscientious, soft-spoken, and aware.“As a Christian and a scientist, I have long been perplexed by the desire that many Christians have for apologetics arguments made by those without training or expertise in the area under discussion. Unfortunately, most Christians don’t know enough about evolutionary biology or population genetics to know if the apologetics they are reading is sound,” Professor Venema in BioLogos stated, “One of the reasons for this series . . . is to try to help reverse that trend. Once one understands the relevant science, one is in a much better position to evaluate an apologetics argument as helpful or misguided.”Venema was announced as the 2019 Scientist in Residence at the Canadian Mennonite University (CMU). In his announcement of the position, he stated, “‘I’m thrilled to be invited to be the Scientist in Residence at CMU for 2019. I think it’s a wonderful opportunity for students, and I am honoured to join a prestigious group of prior participants,’ he says. ‘I hope that these conversations can help students along the path to embracing both God’s word and God’s world as a source of reliable revelation to us.’”Venema ruffled many feathers, too. John Blanton in “The Years of Living Stupidly”stated, “the background is fascinating, but the intent of Evolution News is to demonstrate that Venema is wrong—genetic similarity does not indicate common descent. Evolution Newssometime ago quit identifying authors, but whoever posted this item failed to get the message. Traditionally, Intelligent Design, a concoction of the Discovery Institute, does not rule out common ancestry. These people tend to allow for that, but they also want us to know that natural, and especially random, process are not at work.” They threw Venema over the cliff for attempting modern reconciliation with the science and the updated readings of his scriptures.Even the Ethics & Public Policy Center’s Michael Cromartie in “Jeff Hardin at the November 2014 Faith Angle Forum” took note of Venema, he stated, “Now, there are challenges with Young Earth creationism, of course… This is Paul Nelson, who is a Young Earth creationist. He is also associated with the Discovery Institute in Seattle, Washington. He says it this way; this is succinctly put: ‘Natural science seems to overwhelmingly point to an old cosmos. It is safe to say that most recent creationists are motivated by religious concerns.’ That’s absolutely true. So the evidence, even for a young Earth creationist like Paul, seems to point against it. People who are trying educate Christian students about this encounter an interesting phenomenon. Take Dennis Venema, who is a professor of biology at Trinity Western University up in British Columbia. He said it this way: ‘I’ve seen students willing to discard nearly the entirety of modern science in order to maintain a particular view.’ So one of the challenges from denying the scientific evidence is that you kind of have to walk away from those things that science seems to be telling us.” That which science appears to tell, or, perhaps, explicitly and overwhelmingly supports.As Amos Young in “Adam and the Genome: Reading Scripture after Genetic Science” observes, “He exposes the challenges that population genetics and research on the genome present to both young earth creationist and intelligent design advocates, addressing specifically the arguments of Michael Behe (whose ideas Venema embraced at one point in his studies as a young and aspiring biologist) and Stephen Meyer, both of whom represent God-of-the-gaps approaches that have waylaid prior apologetic endeavors. Some of the terrain is dense, but evangelical Christians interested in understanding better the science of evolutionary genomics will be richly rewarded for their patience.” Venema is one of my favourite people because of the deeper involvement in the more sophisticated creationist communities, as seen in Intelligent Design, while rejecting them and becoming a science educator and theological bridge divider in the process, where he functions in this capacity in the heart of Evangelicalism in Canada. It’s impressive.It should be noted. As John Farrell of Forbes in “‘Adam And The Genome’ Offers A New Approach To Counter Creationism” states, Dennis Venema grew up in a conservative religious home, where the Bible was considered the literal truth of the creator of the human species. So, Venema is coming out of this steep involvement in Christianity. A formulation of Christian doctrine and faith, which he would, eventually, reject and/or adapt to modern biological science. Farrell quotes Venema, “Put most simply, DNA evidence indicates that humans descend from a large population because we, as a species, are so genetically diverse in the present day that a large ancestral population is needed to transmit that diversity to us. To date, every genetic analysis estimating ancestral population sizes has agreed that we descend from a population of thousands, not a single ancestral couple. Even though many of these methods are independent of one another, all methods employed to date agree that the human lineage has not dipped below several thousand individuals for the last three million years or more—long before our lineage was even remotely close to what we would call ‘human.’”Colleagues argue for a framework incorporating a “secular science” ideational divide with, by logical derivation, the idea of theological science on the other side, at times, which doesn’t hold water. For example, R. Scott Clark in “Revisiting the URC Creation Decision“ talks about the Bylogos commentary of Professor of Mathematics, Dr. John Byl, of Trinity Western University. He presents an intelligent, articulate, and engaging commentary on the subject matter. Yet, when reviewing Byl’s commentary in “The Framework Hypothesis and Church Unity,” all this seems as if a huge waste of time and space. These wouldn’t have to be major issues to tackle, except in the light of fundamentalist theology, as such, usually irreconcilable with evolutionary theory or modern biological science. As Byl, in the original article, states, “Church unity should be based on mutual faithfulness to Scripture. The Framework Hypothesis denies the plain sense of Scripture (cf. Gen.1, Ex.20:11, Ex.31:17) and introduces a new hermeneutic that interprets the Bible in light of secular science,” which is – ahem – unfortunate. There’s no secular science; unless, your religion is anti-science, where the implication is the religion incorporates anti-scientific ideas (forms of Creationism and Intelligent Design) leading to the clear irreconcilability.Sometimes, the waters are so muddy, mixed, and confused as to leave one baffled at otherwise intelligent and thoughtful commentary dip into the heady waters of parsing further non-sense from the first non-sense. Derivative non-sense is still non-sense. Robert Stackpole presents part of the fundamental issue, not by statement but, by the implication of the statement about evolution and Creationism, and Intelligent Design. He, in “Reflecting on Creation and the Cross with our Evangelical Friends,” states:Well, in a nutshell, I agree that Young-Earth Creationism, well-intentioned as it is, is indeed biblically unnecessary and scientifically very problematic — and I am afraid that pursuing this position is one of the things that has tarnished the reputation of Evangelicals as being anti-science (or at least, failing to take science very seriously). But what the Catholic Evolutionist party-line rarely adds is that Young Earth Creationism is not the only other option. There are other forms of creationism which I found to be far more convincing, both on biblical and on scientific grounds — such as Old Earth or Progressive Creationism — positions which have been explored and developed in depth and detail by some Evangelical scholars, and that actually fit remarkably well with the findings of the new “Intelligent Design” movement in science and philosophy. As a result, I spent a couple of years researching this option, and co-authored a book on the subject with an Evangelical biochemist from Trinity Western University, Dr. Paul Brown. Entitled More Than Myth: seeking the full truth about Genesis, Creation and Evolution (Chartwell Press, 2014). Our book is an ecumenical milestone, as far as we know: the first ever collaboration on this subject by Catholic and Evangelical scholars.He looks at all the wrong ideas, fervently, including “Young-Earth Creationism,” ‘Old Earth Creationism,’ “Progressive Creationism,” and “Intelligent Design.” His world becomes more complex than necessary and leads to a series of incorrect pathways of thoughts in terms of coming to some approximation of the truth. (He wrote this mentioned book in collaboration with Dr. Paul Brown from Trinity Western University.) The trends of promoting pseudoscience continues in connection with this particular Evangelical Christian University.There is good work by some other individuals, too, not simply Venema, e.g., Professor Craig D. Allert (Religious Studies) of Trinity Western University produced the book entitled Revelation, Truth, Canon and Interpretation: Studies in Justin Martyr’s Dialogue with Trypho (2002). According to Philip J. Long in “Book Review: Craig D. Allert, Early Christian Readings of Genesis One,” he draws heavily on resources from Answers in Genesis (AiG), Institute for Creation Research (ICR), and Creation Ministries International (CMI), i.e., several of the major creationist organizations mentioned above. He provides reason to critique them.Even politically, this pops up. Peter O’Neil in the National Post reported on this in “Canadians who believe in creation ‘gagged,’ B.C. MP charges.” Including Independent MP James Lunney, he considered millions of Canadians who are creationists as gagged. He stated, “I am tired of seeing my faith community mocked and belittled… To not respond is to validate my accusers and, worse yet, imply that I lack the courage of my convictions to stand up for what I believe. … That is not a legacy I wish to leave behind.” The Canadian Press in “Tory says creationism only ‘one issue’“ stated, “Progressive Conservative Leader John Tory is downplaying his policy on bringing private religious schools into the public system after stirring up controversy with comments on teaching creationism. A day after Tory said creationism could be taught in public religious schools, he says voters shouldn’t just judge him on the basis of his proposal to fund faith-based schools.” It emerged over and over again. It continues, too. If you don’t see it, please look closer.The anti-scientific is not only political, but educational. David R. Wheeler/David Wheeler in The Atlantic article entitled “Old Earth, Young Minds: Evangelical Homeschoolers Embrace Evolution“ said, “But whatever their reason for homeschooling, evangelical families who embrace modern science are becoming more vocal about it — and are facing the inevitable criticism that comes with that choice.” So, there can be pushback within specific sectors, including large domains of Creationism with American society. It’s like this in several domains. The churches have been bastions of furthering this pseudoscience. While, the Canadian religious institutions, particularly Christian, have been obstinate in furthering anti-science agendas. Yet, it takes individuals like Venema to almost single-handedly provide a bulwark against these onslaughts against proper scientific education. The belief in the incredible takes a fantastic ability to parse one’s mind apart from a unifying framework; it represents a psychologically confused state. These issues are historical, but these concerns are active, present, and will continue into the future.There have been issues with academic freedom too, in religious private schools, which will be covered in another article.[1] “Freethought for the Small Towns: A Case Study,” (2020), in large part, states:Small towns all over Canada mirror many of the dynamics, magical thinking, and reliance on false or pseudo-medicines in place of (actual) or efficacious medicine. Among the local churches in the area, (e.g., Fort Langley Evangelical Free Church, Living Waters Church, Fraser Point Church – Meeting Place, St George’s Anglican Church, United Churches of Langley – St. Andrew’s Chapel, Vineyard Christian Fellowship, Fraser Point Church Offices, Jubilee Church, and Fellowship Pacific) different interpretations of the Gospels may be taught, but the community retains its Christian ‘spirit’ – in spite of a scuffed, mind you, rainbow crosswalk one can find the in the town business center – with many of the 100+ local businesses hiring many, many Trinity Western University students. The economy is integrated with the institution, in other words…In its recent history, as a starter example, there has been some predictable commentary flowing in the pens and notifications. One from Derek Bisset exhibited a particularly interesting article entitled “There Are Atheists in the Church“ as recent as August 4, 2015. Not necessarily a rare view, it’s more a common sentiment based on the trend line of history and the adaptations for the modern world with Liberal Theology and the tenuous status of some foundational tenets with the continual onslaughts of modern empiricism……Issue 48 of the Fort Langley Evangelical Free Church from 2017, they describe an event with The Canadian Scientific and Christian Affiliation. An organization – The Canadian Scientific and Christian Affiliation, akin to the Templeton Foundation, devoted to strange attempts at bridging religion and science. Although, the Templeton Foundation comes with a huge cash prize. That’s motivation enough for some. The Canadian Scientific and Christian Affiliation focuses on science and a “life-giving Christian tradition” with a statement of faith (common in Christian organizations throughout the country):We confess the Triune God affirmed in the Nicene and Apostles’ creeds which we accept as brief, faithful statements of Christian doctrine based upon Scripture.We accept the divine inspiration, trustworthiness and authority of the Bible in matters of faith and conduct.We believe that in creating and preserving the universe God has endowed it with contingent order and intelligibility, the basis of scientific investigation.We recognize our responsibility, as stewards of God’s creation, to use science and technology for the good of humanity and the whole world.These four statements of faith spell out the distinctive character of the CSCA, and we uphold them in every activity and publication of the Affiliation.As implicitly admitted in the “Commission on Creation” of the American Scientific Affiliation taken by The Canadian Scientific and Christian Affiliation for presentation to its national public, some members of the affiliation will adhere to a “Young-Earth (Recent Creation) View,” “Old-Earth (Progressive Creation) View,” “Theistic Evolution (Continuous Creation, Evolutionary Creation) View,” or “Intelligent Design View.” There’s the problem right there. Only one real game in town, evolution via natural selection… This becomes four wrong views plus one right position with the four incorrect views bad in different ways or to different degrees, i.e., four theological views and one scientific view. In other words, the Canadian Scientific and Christian Affiliation, by its own claims and standards, amounts to a theological affiliation, not a “Scientific” affiliation. It’s false advertising if not outright lying by title and content.Anyway, the Issue 48 newsletter of the Fort Langley Evangelical Free Church presented the event entitled “Science, Religion, & the New Atheism,” by Dr. Stephen Snobelen, who is an Associate Professor of the History of Science and Technology Programme at University of King’s College, Halifax. This is common too… In short, the only places, or the vast majority of places, to present these ideas are churches and religious institutions. Outside of those, these theological hypotheses posed as scientific aren’t taken seriously or, generally, are seen as a hysterical joke when posed as science rather than theology. Some, like Zak Graham in “Atheism is simply a lack of belief,” get the point published in The Langley Times. That seems like an uncommon stance in the wider community.As Brad Warner notes in a short confessional post in Fellowship Pacific, he came to the Christian religion in university… Even in some indications of the counselling professionals in the area, as an individual case study, statements emerge as in Alex Kwee, Ph.D., R.Psych. stating, “A distinctive of my approach lies in the fact that I am a Christian. The practice of psychotherapy is never value-neutral; even the most ostensibly ‘objective’ of counsellors must possess certain irreducible value propositions—even atheism or secular humanism are value systems that cannot be proven ‘right’ one way or another.” Note, he makes Christianity or Christian identity as part of the approach, as I am certain of the same for countless others in the area and around the country……The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 or the DSM-5 rejected sex addiction for inclusion in 2013. There’s no such thing as sex addiction as a formal psychological construct; sex addiction is a theological construct, i.e., a pseudoscientific and worldview construct posed as psychological… As Dr. Darrel Ray in “Extensive Interview with Dr. Darrel Ray on Secular Therapy and Recovering From Religion“ stated:So, #2 behind the fear of hell are issues around their sexuality and things like, “I know it’s not wrong to masturbate, but I still feel guilty,” “I am a sex addict because I look at porn.” There’s tons of evidence that the most religious people self-identify the most as “sex addicts.” Not to mind, there is no such thing as sex addiction. There’s no way to define it. I have argued with atheists that have been atheists for 20 years who say that they are sex addicts. Help me understand, how did you get that diagnosis? “My mother-in-law diagnosed me” [Laughing]. “I look at porn once or twice a week.” I do not care if you look at porn once or twice an hour. You are still not a sex addict. So, get over that. You may have other issues. You may have some compulsions. You may have some fear of driving the issue. But it almost always comes down to early childhood religious training, as we spoke about earlier. So, people are simply responding to the programming. Even though, they are atheist, secular, agnostic. I do not care what you call yourself. You are still dealing with the programming. Sometimes, you can go an entire lifetime with a guilt, a shame, a fear, rooted in religion.…It’s like this on issue and after issue. Fundamentalist Christian universities and theological beliefs in areas infect towns, attract similarly minded individuals from around the fundamentalist Christian diaspora, and reduce the amount of proper science in professional lives and the critical thinking in the public……Fort Langley culture follows from the culture of Trinity Western University on a number of qualitative-observational metrics… One TWU is one LGBTI community group around campus without formal affiliation (“*We are run completely independently from and bare no formal affiliation with Trinity Western University”), though small, for individual students who may be struggling on or around campus. While others outside the formal TWU community, and in the extended fundamentalist Christian community, and taking the idea of “think differently” differently – as in “think the same, as always,” Richard Peachey is as fast as proclaiming the literal Word of God Almighty with homosexuality as an affront to God and fundamentally a sin in His sight. In spite of this, at one time or another, based on Canadian reportage and some names in the current listings, Matthew Wigmore, Bryan Sandberg, and David Evans-Carlson (co-founders of One TWU), and Nate/Nathan Froelich, Kelsey Tiffin, Robynne Healey, and others in the current crop – Kieran Wear, Elisabeth Browning, Queenie Rabanes, and Micah Bron – stand firm against some former mandatory community covenant standards either as supports for themselves or as allies who have been negatively impacted by the Community Covenant. A minority gender and sexual identity is completely healthy and normal. If the theology rejects this, then the theology is at odds with reality, not the students’ sense of themselves, who they love, and their identities, or the science. I agree with them and stand far more with them……Congratulations for making it this far, but freethought extends into other areas too, of the local culture, as with hundreds of towns in this country, whether colonics/colonhydrotherapy, aromatherapy, chiropractory, acupuncture, reflexology, naturopathy/naturopathic medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, or simply a culture of praying for help with an ailment (which is one overlap with the religious fundamentalist community and the reduced capacity for critical thought). Colonics/colonhydrotherapy is marginally practiced within some of the town in Fort Langley Colonics. Dr. Stephen Barrett, M.D. in “Gastrointestinal Quackery: Colonics, Laxatives, and More“ stated rather starkly…In 2009, Dr. Edzard Ernst tabulated the therapeutic claims he found on the Web sites of six “professional organizations of colonic irrigations.” The themes he found included detoxification, normailzation [sic] of intestinal function, treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, and weight loss. He also found claims elated to asthma, menstrual irregularities, circulatory disorders, skin problems, and improvements in energy levels. Searching Medline and Embase, he was unable to find a single controlled clinical trial that substantiated [sic] any of these claims.On aromatherapy, this one is a softball. One can find this in the True Aromatherapy Products and Spa (TAP) store. As William H. London, in an article entitled “Essential Considerations About Aromatherapy“ in Skeptical Inquirer, describes the foundations of aromatherapy as follows, “The practice of administering plant-derived essential oils on the skin, via inhalation of vapors, or internally via ingestion for supposed healing power is commonly called aromatherapy. The oils for aromatherapy are described as ‘essential’ to refer to the volatile, aromatic components that some people describe as the ‘essence’ of the plant source, which represents the plant’s ‘life force,’ ‘spirit,’ or soul. Aromatherapy is thus rooted in vitalism…” RationalWiki states:Like most woo, aromatherapy starts with observable, real effects of smells on humans, and extrapolates and exaggerates into a whole range of treatments from the effective, to the banal, to the outright ridiculous……To chiropractory, it is widely regarded as a pseudoscience with either no efficacy or negative effects on the patient or the client. Fort Family Chiropractic [Ed. Lana Patterson and Shaun Patterson] and Evergreen Chiropractic [Ed. Mike Titchener.] are the two main businesses devoted to some practice of chiropractory. As Science-Based Medicine in its “Chiropractic” entry states:Chiropractic was invented by D. D. Palmer, Sep 18, 1895 when he adjusted the spine of a deaf man and allegedly restored his hearing (a claim that is highly implausible based on what we know of anatomy). Based on this one case, Palmer decided that all disease was due to subluxation: 95% to subluxations of the spine and 5% to subluxations of other bones.The rationale for chiropractic hinges on three postulates:Bones are out of placeBony displacements cause nerve interferenceManipulating the spine replaces the bones, removing the nerve interference and allowing Innate (a vitalistic life force) to restore health.There is no credible evidence to support any of these claims……Acupuncture is another issue. Hardman Acupuncturist & TCM [Ed. “William O. Hardman”], Integrated Health Clinic, devote themselves, in part, to this. Dr. Steven Novella of Science-Based Medicine in “Acupuncture Doesn’t Work“ stated:…according to the usual standards of medicine, acupuncture does not work.Let me explain what I mean by that. Clinical research can never prove that an intervention has an effect size of zero. Rather, clinical research assumes the null hypothesis, that the treatment does not work, and the burden of proof lies with demonstrating adequate evidence to reject the null hypothesis. So, when being technical, researchers will conclude that a negative study “fails to reject the null hypothesis.”……In layman’s terms, acupuncture does not work – for anything.This has profound clinical, ethical, scientific, and practical implications. In my opinion humanity should not waste another penny, another moment, another patient – any further resources on this dead end. We should consider this a lesson learned, cut our losses, and move on.…Another issue practice is reflexology, as seen in Health Roots & Reflexology [Ed. Lisa Kako, Alison Legge.]. Quackwatch concludes, “Reflexology is based on an absurd theory and has not been demonstrated to influence the course of any illness… Claims that reflexology is effective for diagnosing or treating disease should be ignored…” …As Dr. Harriet Hall in “Modern Reflexology: Still As Bogus As Pre-Modern Reflexology“ said, “Reflexology is an alternative medicine system that claims to treat internal organs by pressing on designated spots on the feet and hands; there is no anatomical connection between those organs and those spots. Systematic reviews in 2009 and 2011 found no convincing evidence that reflexology is an effective treatment for any medical condition. Quackwatch and the NCAHF agree that reflexology is a form of massage that may help patients relax and feel better temporarily, but that has no other health benefits…”…A larger concoction of bad science and medicine comes from the Integrated Health Clinic[Ed. Kaiden Maxwell, Gurdev Parmar, Karen Parmar, Michelle Willis, Karen McGee, Erik Boudreau, Adam Davison, Nicole Duffee, Erin Rurak, Alyssa Fruson, Alanna Rinas, Sarah Soles, Wayne Phimister, and Alfred Man. Many, not all, in part or in whole, trained in and practicing pseudosciences – pseudomedicine – found in acupuncture, naturopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, craniosacral therapy, the Bowen technique, and so on. One can integrate several pseudosciences to formulate a clinic for ‘medicine.’ However, all this amounts to an elaborate integration of pseudosciences, an integrated pseudoscience clinic, whether in a quaint fundamentalist religious community village or not.] devoted, largely, to naturopathy/naturopathic medicine (based on a large number of naturopaths on staff) and traditional Chinese medicine with manifestations in IV/chelation therapy, neural therapy, detox, hormone balancing & thermography, anthroposophical medicine, LRHT/hyperthermia, Bowen technique, among others. We’ll run through those first two, as the references to them are available in the resources, in the manner before. Scott Gavura in “Naturopathy vs. Science: Facts edition” stated:Naturopaths claim that they practice based on scientific principles. Yet examinations of naturopathic literature, practices and statements suggest a more ambivalent attitude. NDhealthfacts.org neatly illustrates the problem with naturopathy itself: Open antagonism to science-based medicine, and the risk of harm from “integrating” these practices into the practice of medicine… Because good medicine isn’t based on invented facts and pre-scientific beliefs – it must be grounded in science. And naturopathy, despite the claims, is anything but scientific.The Skeptic’s Dictionary stated:Naturopathy is often, if not always, practiced in combination with other forms of “alternative” health practices... Claims that these and practices such as colonic irrigation or coffee enemas “detoxify” the body or enhance the immune system or promote “homeostasis,” “harmony,” “balance,” “vitality,” and the like are exaggerated and not backed up by sound research.As Dr. David Gorski, as quoted in RationalWiki, stated, “Naturopathy is a cornucopia of almost every quackery you can think of. Be it homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, applied kinesiology, anthroposophical medicine, reflexology, craniosacral therapy, Bowen Technique, and pretty much any other form of unscientific or prescientific medicine that you can imagine, it’s hard to think of a single form of pseudoscientific medicine and quackery that naturopathy doesn’t embrace or at least tolerate.” The Massachusetts Medical Society stated similar terms, “Naturopathic medical school is not a medical school in anything but the appropriation of the word medical. Naturopathy is not a branch of medicine…”…Now, onto Traditional Chinese Medicine or TCM, or Chinese Medicine or CM, also coming out of the Integrated Health Clinic, RationalWiki notes some of the dangerous, if not disgusting to a North American and Western European palette, ingredients:CM ingredients can range from common plants, such as dandelion, persimmon, and mint, to weird or even dangerous stuff. Some of the more revolting (from a Western standpoint) things found in TCM include genitals of various animals (including dogs, tigers, seals, oxen, goats, and deer), bear bile (commonly obtained by means of slow, inhumane extraction methods), and (genuine) snake oil… Urine, feces, placenta and other human-derived medicines were traditionally used but some may no longer be in use.Some of the dangerous ingredients include lead, calomel (mercurous chloride), cinnabar (red mercuric sulfide), asbestos (including asbestiform actinolite, sometimes erroneously called aconite) realgar (arsenic), and birthwort (Aristolochia spp.). Bloodletting is also practiced. Bizarrely, lead oxide, cinnabar, and calomel are said to be good for detoxification. Lead oxide is also supposed to help with ringworms, skin rashes, rosacea, eczema, sores, ulcers, and intestinal parasites, cinnabar allegedly helps you live longer, and asbestos…Dr. Arthur Grollman, a professor of pharmacological science and medicine at Stony Brook University in New York, in an article entitled “Chinese medicine gains WHO acceptance but it has many critics” is quoted, on the case of TCM or CM acceptance at the World Health Organization, saying, “It will confer legitimacy on unproven therapies and add considerably to the costs of health care… Widespread consumption of Chinese herbals of unknown efficacy and potential toxicity will jeopardize the health of unsuspecting consumers worldwide.” On case after case, we can find individual practices or collections of practices of dubious effect if not ill-effect in the town. Indeed, this follows from one of the earliest points about the infusion of supernatural thinking or pseudoscientific integration of praxis into the community, whether fear of liberal theology, encouragement of pseudobiology, prejudice and bigotry against the LGBTI members of community, pseudo-psychological diagnoses passed off as real psychological and behavioural issues while simply grounded in theological bias and false assertions as psychological constructs, or in the whole host of bad medical and science practices seen in “colonics/colonhydrotherapy, aromatherapy, chiropractory, acupuncture, reflexology, naturopathy/naturopathic medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.”[2] The current Council of the Township of Langley consists of Cllr. Petrina Arnason, Cllr. David Davis, Cllr. Steve Ferguson, Cllr. Margaret Kunst, Cllr. Bob Long, Cllr. Kim Richter, Cllr. Blair Whitmarsh, Cllr. Eric Woodward and Mayor Jack Froese.[3] Canadians’ and Others’ Convictions to Divine Interventionism in the Matters of the Origins and Evolution states:Canadian Mennonite University invited Professor Dennis Venema from Trinity Western University as the Scientist in Residence. Venema, at the time, stated, “I’m thrilled to be invited to be the Scientist in Residence at CMU for 2019. I think it’s a wonderful opportunity for students, and I am honoured to join a prestigious group of prior participants… I hope that these conversations can help students along the path to embracing both God’s word and God’s world as a source of reliable revelation to us.” Venema defends the view of evolutionary theory within a framework of “evolutionary creationism,” which appears more a terminologically diplomatic stance than evolution via natural selection or the code language within some religious commentary as things like or almost identical to “atheistic evolution” or “atheistic evolutionism.” He provides education on the range of religious views on offer with a more enticing one directed at evolution via natural selection. The Canadian Scientific and Christian Affiliation provides a space for countering some of the young earth geologist and young earth creationist viewpoints, as with the advertisement of the Dr. Jonathan Baker’s lecture, or in pamphlets produced on geological (and other) sciences.He works in a tough area within a community not necessarily accepting of the evolution via natural selection view of human beings with a preference for special creation, creationism, or intelligent design. Much of the problems post-genetics as a proper discipline of scientific study and the discovery of evolution via natural selection comes from the evangelical Christian communities’ sub-cultures who insist on a literal and, hence, fundamentalist interpretation or reading of their scriptures or purported holy texts. Another small item of note. Other universities have writers in residence. A Mennonite university hosts a scientist in residence. Science becomes the abnorm rather than the norm. The King’s University contains one reference in the search results within a past conference. However, this may be a reference to “creation” rather than “creationism” as creation and more “creation” speaking to the theological interpretations of genesis without an attempt at an explicit scientific justification of mythology.By far, the largest number of references to “creationism” came from the largest Christian, and evangelical Christian, university in the country located in Langley, British Columbia, Canada called Trinity Western University, which, given its proximity and student body population compared to the local town, makes Fort Langley – in one framing – and Trinity Western University the heart of fundamentalist evangelical Christianity in Canada. Trinity Western University teaches a “SCS 503 – Creationism & Christainity [sic] (Korean)” course and a “SCS 691 – Creationism Field Trip” course. They hosted a lecture on Stephen Hawking, science, and creation, as stated:In light of Steven Hawking’s theories, is there enough reason for theists to believe in the existence of God and the creation of the world?This lecture will respond to Hawking’s views and reflect on the relationship between science, philosophy and theology.Speaker: Dr. Yonghua Ge, Director of Mandarin Theology Program at ACTS Seminaries (Ibid.)They hosted another event on evolution and young earth creationism:All are welcome to attend, Public Lecture, hosted by TWU’s ‘Science, Faith, and Human Flourishing: Conversations in Community” Initiative, supported by Fuller Seminary, Faculty of Natural and Applied Sciences, and the Canadian Scientific & Christian Affiliation, “Evolutionary and Young-Earth Creationism: Two Separate Lectures” (Darrel Falk, “Evolution, Creation and the God Who is Love” and Todd Wood, “The Quest: Understanding God’s Creation in Science and Scripture”)Dirk Büchner, Professor of Biblical Studies at Trinity Western University, states an expertise in “Hebrew Bible / Old Testament, Hebrew, Aramaic and Syriac (grammar and syntax), Hellenistic Greek (grammar and lexicography), The Septuagint. Of more popular interest: The Bible and Social Justice, and Creationism, Scientism and the Bible: why there should be no conflict between mainstream science and Christian faith.” Professor Büchner holds an expert status in “creationism.” A non-conflict between mainstream science and the Christian faith would mean the significantly reduced status of the intervention of the divine in the ordinary life of Christians. He remains one locus of creationism in the Trinity Western University environment. Dr. Paul Yang’s biography states, “Paul Yang has over twenty years teaching experience, lecturing on physics and physics education, as well as Christian worldview and creationism. He has served as the director of the Vancouver Institute for Evangelical Wordlview [Sic] as well as the Director of the Christian.” Yang holds memberships or affiliations with the American Scientific Affiliation, Creation Research Society, and Korea Association of Creation Research. Dr. Alister McGrath and Dr. Michael Shermer had a dialogue moderated by a panel with Paul Chamberlain, Ph.D., Jaime Palmer-Hague, Ph.D., and Myron Penner, Ph.D. in 2017 at Trinity Western University.All exist as probably Christian front organizations with the pretense as scientific and Christian organizations. One can see the patterns repeat themselves over and over again. Christian ‘science’ amounts to creationism, as noted before. Yang, with more than 20 years, exists as a pillar of creationist teaching, thinking, and researching within Canada and at Trinity Western University……Other cases of the more sophisticated and newer brands of Christianity with a similar theology, but more evolutionary biology – proper – incorporated into them exist in some of the heart of parts of evangelical Christianity in Canada. Professor Dennis Venema of Trinity Western University and his colleague Dave Navarro (Pastor, South Langley Church) continued a conversation on something entitled “evolutionary creation,” not “creation science” or “intelligent design” as Venema’s orientation at Trinity Western University continues to focus on the ways in which the evolutionary science can mix with a more nuanced and informed Christian theological worldview within the Evangelical tradition. One can doubt the fundamental claim, not in the Bible but, about the Bible as the holy God-breathed or divinely inspired book of the creator of the cosmos, but one can understand the doubt about the base claim about the veracity of the Bible leading to doubt about the contents and claims in the Bible – fundamental and derivative……A more small-time politician, Dr. Darrell Furgason, ran for public office in Chilliwack, British Columbia, Canada. Furgason lectured at Trinity Western University and earned a Ph.D. in Religious Studies. Dr. Furgason claims inclusivity for all while ignoring standard protocol in science, i.e., asserting religious views in written work, “Theistic evolution is a wrong view of Genesis, as well as history, and biology. Adam & Eve were real people….who lived in real history….around 6000 years ago.” ..…The main fundamentalist Evangelical Christian postsecondary institution, university, found in Canadian society is Trinity Western University, where Professor Dennis Venema was the prominent individual referenced as the source of progress in the scientific discussions within intellectual and, in particular, formal academic discussions and teaching. Trinity Western University operates near Fort Langley, British Columbia, Canada in Langley. The main feature case for Story comes from a city near to Trinity Western University in Abbotsford, British Columbia. Story considers this the single most controversial case of creationism in the entire country……John Sutherland, of Trinity Western University, chaired the Abbotsford school board of the time, which, potentially, shows some relationship between the surrounding areas and the school curriculum and creationism axis – as you may recall Trinity Western University sits in Fort Langley, British Columbia, Canada, next to the city of Abbotsford, British Columbia as an evangelical Christian university. “The Minister agreed with Goodman and the Teachers’ Association and sent a letter requesting assurances from the board that they were adhering to the provincial curriculum…”, Story explained, “…The Minister’s requests were not directly acknowledged, but Sutherland was vocal about the issue in local media outlets. He accused the Minister of religious prejudice by attempting to remove creationism from the district.”See “Canadians’ and Others’ Convictions to Divine Interventionism in the Matters of the Origins and Evolution”: https://www.newsintervention.com/creationism-evolution-jacobsen/.[4] Science and Faith: A Conversation in Community, With Darrel Falk & Todd Wood“ states:Darrel Falk is Senior Advisor for Dialog and former president of BioLogos.

    "text": "Icons in the sky: Working list of tallest toro ellipsoidal water towers in the USA Source: lumiflonusa.com/ Toro ellipsoidal water towers (a.k.a. “Toro” or “Torus” water towers) are a design name you might not recognize when you hear it, but if you saw one, you would know the style immediately. These enormous towers tend to have a number of columns holding them up and then have a relatively narrow, oval shaped tank at the top that is considerably wider than it is tall. In some instances, one can see a resemblance to an alien spaceship on legs (see Kohler, WI below), while others may shaped like an oversized watermelon (see Luling, TX below). Triple Kohler Water Towers in Wisconsin – Source: sheboyganpress.com One of the primary advantages of the Toro type of water tower is listed in the quote below.“Multi-column tanks are typically preferred in areas of high wind and/or seismic activity.”Source: phoenixtank.comAnother advantage that is not mentioned is their extra wide metal canvas allows for some fantastic painted images on the towers. Check out the Toro towers pictured throughout this post for some iconic examples. What a better way to demonstrate and broadcast local pride than with a giant, colorful mural some 150 feet in the air! Luling, TX – Source: atlasobscura.com Sadly, as the list below will show, these Toro ellipsoidal water towers are another vanishing breed. As hydropillars and composite towers become more common, Toros are tending to fade from the landscape. If you see one, be sure to admire it, as fewer and fewer remain standing each year. The frustrating part is that some cities and towns do find ways to successfully care for and preserve their iconic towers over the years, while others seem not to care. One of this authors favorites in on the west side of Tampa that includes an ode to the city’s cigar-making history – Source: yelp.com If cities in Florida can so beautifully maintain and restore their iconic Toro towers in the heat, humidity, tropical storms, and salty air of the the Sunshine State, it seems the same could/should be done elsewhere with a dedicated and sustained plan and effort to do so.“Each historic water tower that is lost feels like yet another bit of our collective identity being discarded. We grew up admiring these enormous structures while riding our bikes around town or while watching the world pass by from the back seat of our parent’s car. They are/were an endearing symbol of home…of our community…of high school…of college…of work…of play. It’s sad to see these iconic pieces of Americana just go by the wayside.”panethos.wordpress.comBelow is the working list with information gathered to date. Lost towers are also included for reference and comparison. Many heartfelt thanks to those folks from the various Public Works/Utilities/Water Departments who responded to my inquiries for their kindness and assistance in helping make this list is accurate as possible. Hopefully, more will respond over time to help make this list as complete as possible.Images of some of the most iconic towers from across the nation have been placed throughout the post to admire and enjoy. Peace!**p.s. A very similar design, toro radial cone water towers will be listed in a separate post.

    "text": "Icons in the sky: Working list of tallest toro ellipsoidal water towers in the USA Source: lumiflonusa.com/ Toro ellipsoidal water towers (a.k.a. “Toro” or “Torus” water towers) are a design name you might not recognize when you hear it, but if you saw one, you would know the style immediately. These enormous towers tend to have a number of columns holding them up and then have a relatively narrow, oval shaped tank at the top that is considerably wider than it is tall. In some instances, one can see a resemblance to an alien spaceship on legs (see Kohler, WI below), while others may shaped like an oversized watermelon (see Luling, TX below). Triple Kohler Water Towers in Wisconsin – Source: sheboyganpress.com One of the primary advantages of the Toro type of water tower is listed in the quote below.“Multi-column tanks are typically preferred in areas of high wind and/or seismic activity.”Source: phoenixtank.comAnother advantage that is not mentioned is their extra wide metal canvas allows for some fantastic painted images on the towers. Check out the Toro towers pictured throughout this post for some iconic examples. What a better way to demonstrate and broadcast local pride than with a giant, colorful mural some 150 feet in the air! Luling, TX – Source: atlasobscura.com Sadly, as the list below will show, these Toro ellipsoidal water towers are another vanishing breed. As hydropillars and composite towers become more common, Toros are tending to fade from the landscape. If you see one, be sure to admire it, as fewer and fewer remain standing each year. The frustrating part is that some cities and towns do find ways to successfully care for and preserve their iconic towers over the years, while others seem not to care. One of this authors favorites in on the west side of Tampa that includes an ode to the city’s cigar-making history – Source: yelp.com If cities in Florida can so beautifully maintain and restore their iconic Toro towers in the heat, humidity, tropical storms, and salty air of the the Sunshine State, it seems the same could/should be done elsewhere with a dedicated and sustained plan and effort to do so.“Each historic water tower that is lost feels like yet another bit of our collective identity being discarded. We grew up admiring these enormous structures while riding our bikes around town or while watching the world pass by from the back seat of our parent’s car. They are/were an endearing symbol of home…of our community…of high school…of college…of work…of play. It’s sad to see these iconic pieces of Americana just go by the wayside.”panethos.wordpress.comBelow is the working list with information gathered to date. Lost towers are also included for reference and comparison. Many heartfelt thanks to those folks from the various Public Works/Utilities/Water Departments who responded to my inquiries for their kindness and assistance in helping make this list is accurate as possible. Hopefully, more will respond over time to help make this list as complete as possible.Images of some of the most iconic towers from across the nation have been placed throughout the post to admire and enjoy. Peace!**p.s. A very similar design, toro radial cone water towers will be listed in a separate post. The primary difference between these and toro ellipsoidal water towers is the lower half of the tank is not elliptical, but consists of a series of triangular pizza slice-shaped cones radiating out from the center column.**_______Note: ~ indicates an approximate tower height, determined by using U.S.G.S. topographic maps and other resources, when available_______Fairfax Hospital Water Tower: Falls Church, VA = 181.67 feet2-3.

    "text": "Papillons et fleurs en ProvenceSpring in Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur sounded appealing. We decided to head south, avoiding the toll roads and icy passes of Switzerland to transit through the Alsace and Jura, skirting the French Alps into Provence. This is the first of two mission logs documenting what we experienced.Coordinates StrasbourgArc-et-SenansMorestelSaint-Martin-de-la-CluzeClellesSisteronDigne-les-BainsLa Robine-sur-GalabreCastellaneCucuronEsclangonRiezLa CiotatCassisLourmarinBonnieuxLacosteRustrelRoussillonGordes Our route into southern France Provence-Alpes-Côte d’AzurWhat is now southern France became the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis in 121 BCE, stretching along the Mediterranean coast from the Alps westward to the Pyrenees and securing a land-bridge to Spain. The Roman’s also referred to the area as Provincia, which is how the term “Provence” came to be applied from the Middle Ages until today. After it was conquered by the Visigoths in the 5th century it was subsequently ruled over by the Franks then Holy Roman Empire, until it became part of France in the 15th century.Today the eastern part is known for the lavender fields, vineyards and picturesque villages that correspond to the modern region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur (PACA). Also known as Région Sud, it is bounded by the Rhône River in the west and Italy to the east; the coastline includes the French Riviera (Côte d’Azur) with well-known cities including Nice, Cannes and Saint-Tropez.🧭 Exploring Strasbourg lies on the Rhine opposite the German city of Kehl, our entry point into France. Here is the seat of the European Parliament (first photo) where 705 MEPs representing 450 million people from 27 states debate/ vote in the free-to-visit plenary chamber. Strasbourg was chosen for this role as a symbol of Franco-German reconciliation following WWII (Alsace has changed hands between them 5 times). The Grande-Île/ historic centre is UNESCO-listed and contains the Cathédrale Notre-Dame, built 1015–1439 (second photo); inside is 16th C. astronomical clock (third photo). The Petite France district has canals, old houses and cobbled streets (final photo).  In Jura we came upon the UNESCO-listed 18th century salt works, Saline Royale, at Arc-et-Senans. A semicircle contains symmetrical buildings with a central Director’s House (first photo). Brine was pumped through 15,000 hollowed-out spruce trunks (second photo) from 12m underground in Salins, 21km away! Incredibly, it was easier to get the salt to the forest (i.e. firewood) than the wood to the salt! Twin evaporation “bernes” once housed iron pans, although these are now only exhibition shells (third photo). We parked-up in the fortified village of Morestel, which had views to the French Alps (final photo).  Our route continued south from Jura, passing the 45th parallel north—the halfway point between the Equator and North Pole—near Saint-Martin-de-la-Cluze (first photo; we’ve also been to the 45th parallel south). The French Alps, seen here from Clelles (second photo), loomed over us as we took fertile valleys and low passes en route to Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur (PACA).  Mountains to gorgeLa Citadelle de Sisteron looks over a town that has been inhabited for 4,000 years (first photo). Across the Durance are vertical strata of Late Jurassic limestone called “Rocher de la Baume” and, at its base, Quartier de la Baume (second photo).  From a farm pitch among olive trees, vegetable and lavender fields near Sisteron (first photo) we drove deeper into Haute-Provence UNESCO Geopark. The small museum in Digne-les-Bains has a collection of fossils and pinned butterflies | papillons, but also a living butterfly garden. Here we met Papilio machaon | the Old World swallowtail (second photo).Un papillon, c’est une fleur partie en vacancesA butterfly is a flower gone on vacationJust up the road from the museum at Dalle aux Ammonites, a 198 million year old rock slab contains ~1,550 fossil ammonoidea (Coroniceras multicostatum) that accumulated over a 100,000 year period (third photo). These extinct creatures developed about 400 million years ago and inhabited Earth’s oceans for over 330 million years; it’s hard to imagine humanity beating that record! At Robine-sur-Galabre the imprint of an ichthyosaur, a marine reptile that evolved fish-like features can be viewed at the end of a 4km out-and-back path (final photo is an adjacent reconstruction, which is slightly clearer).  The trail was extensively decorated with violet and yellow spring flowers:Hepatica nobilisPrimula vulgarisStill in Haute-Provence UNESCO Geopark, at Serre d’Esclangon a 1km return path offers views of Clue du Pérouré (first photo), where folding has flipped the strata so that the younger Cretaceous layer sits below older Jurassic rock. It’s possible to continue the trail for a broader view of the Bès valley and the Clues from a plateau at Vieil Esclangon (second photo). Further onward, looking back towards the refuge hut (third photo). From the 1,150m Serre summit, a brief view to the curved ridges of a geological feature known as the “Vélodrome”—we arrived just ahead of sleet (final photo)! Geologists are uncertain how it was formed.  This hike was 4.2km/ 1h 40m return:From Digne-les-Bains we took the winding D20 pass, reaching 1,112m at Col de Corobin and stopping for a view from the mountain “village” of Le Clappe (first photo). At Chaudon-Norante we joined Route Napoléon (second photo) towards Castellane. We stopped en route for a hike to Eocene fossils of Halitherium taulanense (siréniens in French)—ancestor to dugongs and manatee (third photo; mostly sturdy rib bones). Also on this hike you can bear witness to a 110 million year erosion-related geological “gap” between Jurassic limestone and 35 million year old sandstone. Seen from the path, the town of Castellane is overlooked by Notre-Dame du Roc (final photo).  The hike to Site des siréniens fossiles was 4km/ 1h 20m return:We drove Gorges du Verdon from the Castellane end, taking about three hours in just 7° with a chilly wind—but few cars (first photo). The many viewpoints soon overwhelmed; knowing photos don’t do this landscape justice, here’s one from Belvédère de Trescaire haut (second photo). At the same spot we found a native Himantoglossum robertianum | giant orchid (third photo). At Belvédère de la Dent d’Aire we saw Gyps fulvus | Eurasian griffon vultures soaring (fourth photo); we’re pretty sure we spotted Aquila chrysaetos | golden eagle too (final photo).    Where next? A pause in Gorges du Verdon to locate a park-up.The CalanquesOur road trip took us from an overnight aire in Riez, an important Roman settlement, to the coast at La Ciotat (southeast of Marseille). There we began the Route des Crêtes, a scenic drive along the clifftops of the Cap Canaille in Parc National des Calanques | Calanques National Park (first photo), to the seaside town of Cassis (second photo)—near, but not in the French Riviera. From the clifftop entrances to the calanques—limestone inlets—are visible (third photo). Later, we took in the view back to the highest sea cliff in France at 394m, seen here from the habour of Cassis (final photo).  The clifftops along the route were decorated with pink and blue flowers:Cistus albidusSalvia rosmarinusWe spent the following day in Parc national des Calanques. First, a one hour boat trip into the three calanques nearest to Cassis’s quaint harbour (first photo), then a hike. Calanque de Port Miou is occupied by a marina and is the least pretty (second photo). Calanque de Port Pin offers accessible bathing (third photo); “Trou Souffleur” is an entertaining thumb-sized blowhole on the nearby point (do listen to “Neptune’s nostril” exhaling, below). Calanque d’en Vau (fourth photo) is easily the most photogenic from above, but the climb down to the pebble beach is very steep in parts.    The unassuming nostril of Neptune!A butterfly-centric selection of “smalls” seen in the Parc follows. Native Gonepteryx cleopatra | cleopatra butterfly, alighted on a blue-flowering rosemary bush (first photo). Native Zerynthia rumina | Spanish festoon, resting on loose limestone rocks that make up much of the path (second photo). Lasiommata megera | wall brown, on tour at one of the trail’s many viewpoints (third photo). Of course there were flowers too; here’s native Globularia alypum | shrubby globularia (final photo).  Here’s the 11km/ 4.5h return hike from Cassis:The LuberonWe next turned inland, to the elevated Luberon region, located in southern Vaucluse. Cucuron was hard-hit by Le Peste | the Plague in 1720–21, loosing a third of its population (first photo). A native Iphiclides podalirius | scarce swallowtail took nectar from flowering rosemary at the town’s remnant 14th C. keep (second photo). We found nearby Lourmarin, with its Renaissance château, shops and cafés, a bit too touristy (third photo). Crossing the Petit Luberon, we came to Bonnieux (final photo); this quiet hilltop village has panoramic views over vineyards and forested hills.  We spent a rather lovely evening at the free (and full) aire de camping-car in Bonnieux. There were lots of white blossoming cherry trees, and the peak in the second photo is Mont Ventoux—the highest in the region at 1,910m and almost 40km distant as the crow flies.  Rinse out the toilet cassette sans water supplySometimes there’s no (free) water to rinse out a toilet cassette at an aire. A neighbour came up with a great solution: he drained off some of his grey waste water into a bucket, then used that to rinse out his toilet cassette.✳️ Tips and tricks We really enjoyed a hike in Parc naturel régional du Luberon between the villages of Bonnieux and Lacoste. The latter hilltop village is crowned by the ruins of Château de Lacoste (first photo). A former 18th century owner, Marquis de Sade, was fond of causing others pain and thus lent his name to “sadism”. En route, we came across a dry-stone conical “borie”, a traditional hut used for shelter or storage (second photo). In Lacoste we explored the steep cobbled streets (third photo) and looked out over the Luberon Valley from the ruin (final photo).  On varied paths between the villages we saw many sights, both near and far. These included the improbable Xylocopa violacea | violet carpenter bee (first photo); skittish jays; raucous frogs (heard but unseen!); rows of lavender; vines; cherry blossoms; olive trees; giant orchids and native Ophrys sphegodes (second photo); oaks; thyme bushes; woodpeckers and one cat the size of a small sheep. Mont Ventoux loomed in the distance (third photo); behind Bonnieux stand the Grand Luberon (final photo).  We made a short recording of the frogs from the path:Here’s the track of our 10km return walk (relaxed, as we dined out in Lacoste):In Forêt des Cèdres on the Petit Luberon massif near Bonnieux Cedrus atlantica | Atlas cedars were planted from Algerian seeds in 1861 (first photo). Also near Bonnieux, the three-arch Pont Julien was built in 3 BCE as part of Via Domitia, the Roman road connecting Italy to Spain. Cleverly, openings in the supports allowed floodwater to pass through more easily (second photo). Colorado provençal at Rustrel is a former 19/20th century ochre mine, with loop walks around the colourful quarry site (third photo). Roussillon also has ochre—and also plenty of tourists (final photo).  Gordes is a hilltop village cutting a fine profile in Le Luberon; the crowning château is 10th century, with subsequent Renaissance renovations (first photo). Sadly the morning market was cancelled (we think due to roadworks), but this gave us some time to admire the landscape from the stone terraces (second photo) before setting out on a hike to local attractions. At Village des Bories we visited a collection of 14–19th century dry-stone huts, once used by farmers and shepherds (third photo). Abbaye Notre-Dame de Sénanque is 12th century Cistercian monastery, still active, now with a shop and surrounded by lavender fields (final photo).    Village des Bories Dry-stone construction of boriesThere are over 400 bories (from the Latin borea | stable) in Gordes. Dry-stone construction—the piling of stones without use of binder/ mortar—is UNESCO-listed as intangible cultural heritage. Those who built bories first de-stoned land by ploughing, then laid a foundation with recovered flat stones. Walls were added by layering with a slight overhang, until the roof could be closed using large flat stones. A borie of 5 square metres internal floor space would occupy 12 square metres of ground and require 50 tonnes of stone! Bories were abandoned towards the end of the 19th century, as part of a rural exodus and other factors; many collapsed or were plundered for stone.🤔 Curiosity Globularia bisnagaricaTragopogon porrifoliusAs well as new-to-us flowers, our path from the bories to the abbey followed a stream bed; in a pool we found debris-encased caddisfly larvae, a positive bioindicator.Caddisfly larvae in a freshwater poolOur 11km loop hike took us 4h 20m:Our journey around Provence continues in the next mission log as we drive next into northern Vaucluse.#2025 #camperVan #europe #france #hiking #nationalPark #nature #nomad #provenceAlpesCôteDAzur #roadTrip #romans #travel #unesco #vanLife",
